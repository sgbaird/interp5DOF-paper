\section{Euclidean and Arc Length Distances}
\label{sec:supp:dist-parity}
The close correlation between Euclidean and arc length distances in the \gls{vfzo} sense is shown in \cref{fig:dist-parity} using pairwise distances of \num{10000} \glspl{vfzo}. This justifies our use of Euclidean distance as an approximation of hyperspherical arc length (and by extension, that a scaled Euclidean distance approximates a non-symmetrized octonion distance, see \cref{eq:8Deuclidean_dist,eq:7sphere_arc_length,eq:omega} of the main paper). However, comparison with the original octonion metric \cite{francisGeodesicOctonionMetric2019} gives overestimation for some boundaries. This is an inherent feature of the \gls{vfzo} framework that can be addressed via use of the ensemble methods described in \cref{sec:methods:framework:vfz-dist} (see also \cref{fig:dist-ensemble-k1-2-10-20,fig:dist-ensemble-rmse-mae}).

\caption{Parity plot of 8D Cartesian hyperspherical arc length vs. 8D Cartesian Euclidean distance for pairwise distances in a ($m\bar{3}m$) symmetrized set of \num{10000} randomly sampled \glspl{vfzo}. The max arc length is approximately \SI{0.58}{\radian}, indicating a max octonion distance of approximately \SI{1.16}{\radian} or \SI{66.5}{\degree} between any two points in the \gls{vfz}. The close correlation between arc length and Euclidean distance supports the validity of using Euclidean distance instead of arc length in the interpolation methods. This is \textit{separate} from the correlation between \gls{vfzo} Euclidean or arc length distances with the traditional octonion distance \cite{chesserLearningGrainBoundary2020}.}

\section{Ensemble Interpolation Results}
\label{sec:ensemble-interp}
Ensemble interpolation is a classic technique that can be used to enhance predictive performance of models. Here we describe our methods (\cref{sec:ensemble-interp:methods}), results (\cref{sec:ensemble-interp:results}), and the potential of integrating ensemble interpolation with a \gls{gprm} scheme (\cref{sec:ensemble-interp:egprm}).

\subsection{Methods}
\label{sec:ensemble-interp:methods}
\Gls{vfzo} ensemble\footnote{Ours is a "bagging"-esque ensemble scheme because the same interpolation method (\acrshort{gpr}) is used but with different representations for the \inpt{} data. } interpolation occurs by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item generating multiple reference octonions to define multiple \glspl{vfz}
    \item obtaining multiple \gls{vfzo} representations for a set of \glspl{gb} based on the various reference octonions
    \item performing an interpolation (e.g. \gls{gpr}) for each of the representations
    \item homogenizing the ensemble of models (e.g. by taking the mean or median of the various models)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:ensemble-interp:results}

Use of an ensemble interpolation scheme decreases interpolation error for a \gls{gpr} model with \num{50000} \inpt{} and \num{10000} \outpt{} \glspl{vfzo}. By using an ensemble size of 10 (i.e. 10 \gls{gpr} models each with different reference octonions and therefore different \glspl{vfz}), \gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} decreased from \SIlist{0.0241;0.0160}{\J\per\square\m} to \SIlist{0.0187;0.0116}{\J\per\square\m}, respectively, using the median homogenization function (\cref{fig:ensemble-interp-rmse-mae}). 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/ensemble-interp-rmse-mae.png}
    \caption{(a) \Gls{rmse} and (b) \gls{mae} vs. ensemble size for mean, median, minimum, and maximum homogenization functions. A \gls{gpr} model with \num{50000} \inpt{} and \num{10000} \outpt{} \glspl{vfzo} was used. }
    \label{fig:ensemble-interp-rmse-mae}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:ensemble-interp} shows the hexagonally binned parity plots for predictions made using the mean, median, minimum, and maximum predicted values over an ensemble of 10 \glspl{vfz}. Qualitatively, the ensemble mean and ensemble median parity plots look similar to those from the main text (\cref{fig:brkparity50000}), though the distributions of the ensemble scheme are somewhat tighter. The ensemble minimum produces better predictions of low \gls{gbe} than any of the other models, but underestimates high \gls{gbe} as expected. Naturally, the ensemble maximum overestimates in general. Diminishing returns manifest in \cref{fig:ensemble-interp-rmse-mae} for mean and median homogenizations. This is to be expected because the original octonion distances \cite{francisGeodesicOctonionMetric2019} are well-approximated using an ensemble size of 10 (\cref{fig:dist-ensemble-k1-2-10-20}c and \cref{fig:dist-ensemble-rmse-mae}).

    \label{fig:ensemble-interp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Possibility: Combining Ensemble with \glsentrytitlecase{gpr}{long} Mixture}
\label{sec:ensemble-interp:egprm}

A scheme which preferentially favors the ensemble minimum for low \gls{gbe} predictions and defaults to ensemble mean or median for all other \glspl{gbe} may produce even better results across the full range of \glspl{gbe}. For example, this could be accomplished by combining the ensemble scheme described here with the \gls{gpr} mixture model described in \cref{sec:supp:kim-interp:method}.

\section{Barycentric Interpolation}
\label{sec:supp:bary}

\subsection{High-Aspect Ratios}
\label{sec:supp:bary:artifact}
An artifact of the barycentric interpolation method which occurs due to the presence of high-aspect ratio facets is shown in \cref{fig:high-aspect-non-int}. As the dimensionality increases for a constant number of points and from our numerical tests, the rate of missed facet intersections increases. This artifact and our method for addressing it are discussed in \cref{sec:app:bary:int} of the main text.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/high-aspect-non-int.png}
    \caption{Illustration of two \outpt{} points (red) for which no intersecting facet is found due to being positioned within a high-aspect ratio facet. The inset shows that facets connected to the \gls{nn} do not contain the \outpt{} point. Many \glspl{nn} would need to be considered before an intersection is found. Additionally, it is expected that if found, the interpolation will suffer from higher error due to use of facet vertices far from the interpolation point. Proper intersections of \outpt{} points with the mesh are shown in blue.}

\section{Kim Interpolation}
\label{sec:supp:kim-interp}

A \gls{gpr} mixing model is developed to accommodate the non-uniformly distributed, noisy Fe simulation data \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} and better predict low \gls{gbe}. Details of the method (\cref{sec:supp:kim-interp:method}) and an analysis of the input data quality (\cref{sec:supp:kim-interp:quality}) are given. The code implementation is given in \texttt{gprmix.m} and \texttt{gprmix\_test.m} of the \vfzorepo{} \cite{bairdFiveDegreeofFreedom5DOF2020}.

\subsection{Details of \glsentrytitlecase{gpr}{long} Mixture}
\label{sec:supp:kim-interp:method}
As shown in \cref{fig:kim-interp-teach}a, prediction using the standard approach of the main document (termed the $\epsilon_1$ model) overestimates low \glspl{gbe} for this dataset. By training the model on only \glspl{gb} with a \gls{gbe} less than \thrtwo{} (termed the $\epsilon_2$ model) and by using an exponential (\matlab{KernelFunction='exponential'}) rather than a squared exponential kernel, prediction of low \glspl{gbe} improves, but naturally underestimation occurs for higher \glspl{gbe} (\cref{fig:kim-interp-teach}b).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{kim-interp-teach.png}
    \caption{(a) Hexagonally binned parity plot of the standard \gls{gpr} model. (b) All prediction \glspl{gb} based on the model using only training \glspl{gb} with a \gls{gbe} less than \thrtwo{}. (c) Combined disjoint model as explained in the text. (d) Hexagonally binned parity plots of the final \gls{gpr} mixing model. Points in (c) are produced by splitting the prediction data into less than and greater than \thr{}. A sigmoid mixing function (\cref{fig:gprmix-sigmoid}) is then applied where the predicted \glspl{gbe} shown in (c) determines the mixing fraction ($f$) to produce a weighted average of models (a) and (b). A large Fe simulation database \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} using \num{46883} training datapoints and \num{11721} validation datapoints in an 80\%/20\% split. The \gls{gpr} mixture model decreases error for low \gls{gbe} and changes overall \gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} from \SI{0.057932}{\J\per\square\meter} and \SI{0.039857}{\J\per\square\meter} in the original model (shown in (a)) to \SI{0.055035}{\J\per\square\meter} and \SI{0.039185}{\J\per\square\meter} (shown in (d)), respectively.}
    \label{fig:kim-interp-teach}
\end{figure}

A combined, disjoint model (\cref{fig:kim-interp-teach}c) is taken ($\epsilon_3$) by replacing $\epsilon_1$ \gls{gbe} predictions for \glspl{gb} with \gls{gbe} less than \thr{} with the corresponding $\epsilon_2$ predictions. Finally, a weighted average (\cref{eq:gprmix}) is taken according to:

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{mix} = f \epsilon_1+(f-1) \epsilon_2
    \label{eq:gprmix}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ represent the standard \gls{gpr} model and the \gls{gpr} model trained on the subset of \glspl{gb} with a \gls{gbe} less than \thrtwo{}, respectively, and $f$ is the sigmoid mixing fraction given by:

\begin{equation}
    f=\frac{1}{e^{-m \left(\epsilon_3-b\right)}+1}
        % f\left(\epsilon_3\right)=\frac{1}{e^{-m \left(\epsilon_3-b\right)}+1}
    \label{eq:sigmoid}
\end{equation}
and shown in \cref{fig:gprmix-sigmoid} with $m=30$ and $b=\sigthr{}$, as used in this work. Larger values of $m$ yield a steeper sigmoid function and larger values of $b$ shift the sigmoid function further to the right. Specific values for $m$ and $b$ were chosen by visual inspection and trial and error. This results in a \gls{gpr} mixing model which better predicts low \glspl{gbe} while retaining overall predictive accuracy (\cref{fig:kim-interp-teach}d).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/gprmix-sigmoid.png}
    \caption{Sigmoid mixing function used in the \gls{gpr} mixing model with $m=30$ and $b=\sigthr{}$ (\cref{eq:sigmoid}).}
    \label{fig:gprmix-sigmoid}
\end{figure}

Uncertainty of the \gls{gpr} mixing model is similarly obtained by taking a weighted average of the uncertainties of each model according to:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{mix} = f \sigma_1+(f-1) \sigma_2
    \label{eq:gprmix-sigma}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the corresponding uncertainties of $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$, respectively, and $f$ is given by \cref{eq:sigmoid}. 

\subsection{Input Data Quality}
\label{sec:supp:kim-interp:quality}
Of the $\sim$\num{60000}\footnote{The "no-boundary" \glspl{gb} (i.e. \glspl{gb} with close to \SI{0}{\joule\per\square\meter} \gls{gbe}) were removed before testing for degeneracy.} \glspl{gb} in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014}, $\sim$\num{10000} \glspl{gb} were repeats that were identified by converting to \glspl{vfzo} and applying \vfzorepo{} function \texttt{avg\_repeats.m}. In \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014}, mechanically selected \glspl{gb} were those which involved sampling in equally spaced increments\footnote{In some cases, this was equally spaced increments of the argument of a trigonometric function.} for each \gls{5dof} parameter, and a few thousand intentionally selected \glspl{gb} (i.e. special \glspl{gb}) were also considered. Of mechanically and intentionally selected \glspl{gb}, \numlist{9170;112} are repeats, respectively, with a total of \num{2496} degenerate sets\footnote{A degenerate "set" is distinct from a \gls{vfzo} "set", the latter of which is often used in the main text.} (see \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-sets} for a degeneracy histogram). Thus, on average there is a degeneracy of approximately four per set of degenerate \glspl{gb}.

By comparing \gls{gbe} values of (unintentionally\footnote{To our knowledge, the presence of repeat \glspl{gb} were not mentioned in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} or \cite{kimIdentificationSchemeGrain2011}}) repeated \glspl{gb} in the Fe simulation dataset \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014}, we can estimate the intrinsic error of the \inpt{} data. For example, minimum and maximum deviations from the average value of a degenerate set are \SIlist{-0.2625;0.2625}{\joule\per\square\meter}, respectively, indicating that a repeated Fe \gls{gb} simulation from \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} can vary by as much as \SI{0.525}{\joule\per\square\meter}, though rare. Additionally, \Gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} values can be obtained within each degenerate set by comparing against the set mean. Overall \gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} are then obtained by averaging and weighting by the number of \glspl{gb} in each degenerate set. Following this procedure, we obtain an average set-wise \gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} of \SIlist{0.06529;0.06190}{\joule\per\square\meter}, respectively, which is an approximate measure of the intrinsic error of the data. \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results} shows histograms and parity plots of the intrinsic error. The overestimation of intrinsic error mentioned in the main text (\cref{sec:results:simulation}) could stem from bias as to what type of \glspl{gb} exhibit repeats based on the sampling scheme used in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} and/or that many of the degenerate sets contain a low number of repeats (\cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-sets}).

Next, we see that by binning \glspl{gb} into degenerate sets, most degenerate sets have a degeneracy of fewer than 5 \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-sets}. We split the repeated data into sets with a degeneracy of fewer than 5 and greater than or equal to 5 and plot the errors (relative to the respective set mean) in both histogram form (\cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}a and \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}c, respectively) and as hexagonally-binned parity plots (\cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}b and \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}d, respectively). While heavily repeated \glspl{gb} tend to give similar results, occasionally repeated \glspl{gb} often have larger \gls{gbe} variability. This could have physical meaning: Certain types of (e.g. high-symmetry) \glspl{gb} tend to have less variation (i.e. fewer and/or more tightly distributed metastable states). However, it could also be an artifact of the simulation setup that produced this data (e.g. deterministic simulation output for certain types of \glspl{gb}).

    \caption{Degenerate \glspl{gb} sets are split into those with a degeneracy of fewer than 5 and greater than or equal to 5 and plotted as ( (a) and (c), respectively) error histograms and ( (b) and (d), respectively) hexagonally-binned parity plots. Large degenerate sets tend to have very low error, whereas small degenerate sets tend to have higher error. In other words, \glspl{gb} that are more likely to be repeated many times based on the sampling scheme in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} tend to give similar results, whereas \glspl{gb} that are less likely to be repeated often have larger variability in the simulation output. We do not know if this has physical meaning or is an artifact of the simulation setup.}

% \subsection{Uncertainty Quantification and the Posterior Distribution of \glsentrytitlecase{gprm}{long} }
% The use of \gls{gpr} in the \gls{gprm} model facilitates uncertainty quantification which we discuss in more detail. We find that use of \cref{eq:gprmix-sigma} on two models with differing amounts of data leads to a model with typically higher uncertainty for low \glspl{gbe} than high \glspl{gbe} (\cref{fig:kim-interp-posterior}a). By observing the \glspl{nn} relative to an arc $\overline{AB}$, we find that there is a large scatter of \glspl{gbe} for \glspl{gb} that are within a radius of $\sim$\SI{6}{\degree} (\cref{fig:kim-interp-posterior}b). By sampling from the posterior distribution, we find that 

% Uncertainty results, as well as posterior samples of the \gls{gprm} distribution of models are shown in \cref{fig:kim-interp-posterior}.

% As illustrated in \cref{fig:olmsted-Ni-loocv}, \gls{loocv} interpolation results for \SI{0}{\kelvin} \gls{ms} low-noise Ni simulations using the \gls{gpr} method are similar to \gls{lkr} results reported in Figure 6a of \citet{chesserLearningGrainBoundary2020} (reproduced on the right of \cref{fig:olmsted-Ni-loocv} for convenience).
