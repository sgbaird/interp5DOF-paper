  abstract = {We generalize the well known Complex Step Method for computing derivatives by introducing a complex step in a strict sense. Exploring different combinations of terms, we derive 52 approximations for computing the first order derivatives and 43 for the second order derivatives. For an appropriate combination of terms and appropriate choice of the step size in the real and imaginary directions, fourth order accuracy can be achieved in a very simple and efficient scheme on a compact stencil. New different ways of computing second order derivatives in one single step are shown. Many of the first order derivative approximations avoid the problem of subtractive cancellation inherent to the classic finite difference approximations for real valued steps, and the superior accuracy and stability of the generalized complex step approximations are demonstrated for an analytic test function. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is well-known that the success of kernel estimators depends heavily on the choice of a smoothing parameter called the bandwidth. A number of data-driven bandwidth selectors exist, but they are all global. Such techniques are appropriate when the density is relatively simple, but local bandwidth selectors can be more attractive in more complex settings. We suggest several data-driven local bandwidth selectors and illustrate via simulations the significant improvement they can bring over a global bandwidth. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This approximation, requiring a single function evaluation at a complex argument, generalizes the complex step approximation known in the scalar case. The approximation is proved to be of second order in h for analytic functions f and also for the matrix sign function. It is shown that it does not suffer the inherent cancellation that limits the accuracy of finite difference approximations in floating point arithmetic. However, cancellation does nevertheless vitiate the approximation when the underlying method for evaluating f employs complex arithmetic. The ease of implementation of the approximation, and its superiority over finite differences, make it attractive when specialized methods for evaluating the Fr\'echet derivative are not available, and in particular for condition number estimation when used in conjunction with a block 1-norm estimation algorithm. \textcopyright{} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.},

  abstract = {A method to reconstruct fields, source strengths and physical parameters based on Gaussian process regression is presented for the case where data are known to fulfill a given linear differential equation with localized sources. The approach is applicable to a wide range of data from physical measurements and numerical simulations. It is based on the well-known invariance of the Gaussian under linear operators, in particular differentiation. Instead of using a generic covariance function to represent data from an unknown field, the space of possible covariance functions is restricted to allow only Gaussian random fields that fulfill the homogeneous differential equation. The resulting tailored kernel functions lead to more reliable regression compared to using a generic kernel and makes some hyperparameters directly interpretable. For differential equations representing laws of physics such a choice limits realizations of random fields to physically possible solutions. Source terms are added by superposition and their strength estimated in a probabilistic fashion, together with possibly unknown hyperparameters with physical meaning in the differential operator.},

Multiresolution by subdivision and reverse subdivision allows one to decrease and restore the resolution of a curve, and is typically defined by affine combinations of points in Euclidean space. While translating such combinations to spherical space is possible, ensuring perfect reconstruction of the curve remains challenging. Hence, current spherical multiresolution schemes tend to be interpolating or midpoint-interpolating, as achieving perfect reconstruction in these cases is more straightforward. We use a simple geometric construction for a non-interpolating and non-midpoint-interpolating multiresolution scheme on the sphere, which is made up of easily generalized components and based on a modified Lane\textendash Riesenfeld algorithm.},

From the measurements, a volume of approximately 4.8 \texttimes{} 106 {$\mu$}m3 containing 451 grains and approximately 1500 GBs was reconstructed. Dominance of \{111\} planes for {$\Sigma$}3n (n = 1, 2, 3) GBs was found. In general, the IC behaviour of random high angle grain boundaries (RHAGBs) and low-{$\Sigma$} coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries ({$\Sigma$} {$\leq$} 29) does not show a large difference. The corrosion behaviour of low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) is strongly dependent on the misorientation angles, while the crystallographic GB plane becomes dominant for the behaviour of low-{$\Sigma$} CSL GBs and RHAGBs. It was found that the corrosion resistance is related on the atom packing density (APD) of the GB plane. High corrosion resistance appears for GBs with high APD values (in particular for the (111) planes with a maximum APD value).},

  abstract = {This article presents a method for generating samples from an unnormalized posterior distribution f({$\cdot$}) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in which the evaluation of f({$\cdot$}) is very difficult or computationally demanding. Commonly, a less computationally demanding, perhaps local, approximation to f({$\cdot$}) is available, say fx*({$\cdot$}). An algorithm is proposed to generate an MCMC that uses such an approximation to calculate acceptance probabilities at each step of a modified Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Once a proposal is accepted using the approximation, f({$\cdot$}) is calculated with full precision ensuring convergence to the desired distribution. We give sufficient conditions for the algorithm to converge to f({$\cdot$}) and give both theoretical and practical justifications for its usage. Typical applications are in inverse problems using physical data models where computing time is dominated by complex model simulation. We outline Bayesian inference and computing for inverse problems. A stylized example is given of recovering resistor values in a network from electrical measurements made at the boundary. Although this inverse problem has appeared in studies of underground reservoirs, it has primarily been chosen for pedagogical value because model simulation has precisely the same computational structure as a finite element method solution of the complete electrode model used in conductivity imaging, or "electrical impedance tomography." This example shows a dramatic decrease in CPU time, compared to a standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. \textcopyright{} 2005 American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Interface Foundation of North America.},

  abstract = {Barycentric coordinates are commonly used to represent a point inside a polygon as an affine combination of the polygon's vertices and to interpolate data given at these vertices. While unique for triangles, various generalizations to arbitrary simple polygons exist, each satisfying a different set of properties. Some of these generalized barycentric coordinates do not have a closed form and can only be approximated by piecewise linear functions. In this paper we show that subdivision can be used to refine these piecewise linear functions without losing the key barycentric properties. For a wide range of subdivision schemes, this generates a sequence of piecewise linear coordinates which converges to non-negative and C1 continuous coordinates in the limit. The power of the described approach comes from the possibility of evaluating the C1 limit coordinates and their derivatives directly. We support our theoretical results with several examples, where we use Loop or Catmull-Clark subdivision to generate C1 coordinates, which inherit the favourable shape properties of harmonic coordinates or the small support of local barycentric coordinates.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare algorithms for solving inverse problems generally encountered in spatial audio signal processing. Tikhonov regularization is typically utilized to solve overdetermined linear systems in which the regularization parameter is selected by the golden section search (GSS) algorithm. For underdetermined problems with sparse solutions, several iterative compressive sampling (CS) methods are suggested as alternatives to traditional convex optimization (CVX) methods that are computationally expensive. The focal underdetermined system solver (FOCUSS), the steepest descent (SD) method, Newton's (NT) method, and the conjugate gradient (CG) method were developed to solve CS problems more efficiently in this study. These algorithms were compared in terms of problems, including source localization and separation, noise source identification, and analysis and synthesis of sound fields, by using a uniform linear array (ULA), a uniform circular array (UCA), and a random array. The derived results are discussed herein and guidelines for the application of these algorithms are summarized.},

However, the complexity and number of parameters involved often limits the extent of this exploration to a small set of interfaces. In this article, we present a fast Monte Carlo scheme for generating zero-Kelvin, low energy GB structures in the five-dimensional crystallographic phase space. The Monte Carlo trial moves include removal and insertion of atoms in the GB region, which create a diverse set of GB configurations and result in a rapid convergence to the low energy structure. We have validated the robustness of this approach by simulating over 1184 tilt, twist, and mixed character GBs in both fcc (Aluminum and Nickel) and bcc ({$\alpha$}-Iron) metallic systems.},

The next point, Xk+1, is then chosen at random according to the conditionalization of {$\pi$} on the line defined by Xk and Xk + \texttheta k+1.

The solver implements Newton's method in function space, where instead of the usual Jacobian matrices, the derivatives involved are F\'rechet derivatives. A major novelty of this approach is the application of automatic differentiation (AD) techniques to compute the operator-valued F\'rechet derivatives in the continuous context. Other novelties include the use of anonymous functions and numbering of each variable to enable a recursive, delayed evaluation of derivatives with forward mode AD. The AD techniques are applied within a new Chebfun class called chebop which allows users to set up and solve nonlinear BVPs, both scalar and systems of coupled equations, in a few lines of code, using the "nonlinear backslash" operator (\textbackslash ). This framework enables one to study the behaviour of Newton's method in function space.

The complexity of the algorithm depends exponentially on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the dimension of ambient space, and linearly on the dimension of the ambient space. Another interesting feature of this work is that no explicit coordinates of the points in the point sample is needed.

In parallel, molecular dynamics simulations of 26 CSL grain boundaries were performed to calculate their formation energies using four different empirical potentials. Comparing calculated formation energies and measured linear fractions allowed us to select the best suited empirical potential for the study of grain boundaries and to evidence a decrease in the formation energy of a given grain boundary when its length fraction increases. Cleavage energies were calculated using the selected potential and the toughness of a grain boundary was estimated, since this property corresponds to the energy needed to open it. An interesting relation is observed: the cleavage energy seems to decrease when the misorientation angle of the boundary increases. Finally, a first step towards the study of non-CSL (i.e. general) grain boundaries was taken by simulating three semi-general grain boundaries built by sticking two halves of CSL boundaries.},

The experiments were conducted on high-purity (99.999\%) aluminum bicrystals by utilizing an in situ technique for the observation and continuous recording of boundary migration. In contrast to pure tilt boundaries, the mixed boundaries were found to readily assume a curved shape and steadily move under the capillary driving force. This behavior is associated with the inclination dependence of boundary energy, which was determined for tilt and mixed boundaries by molecular statics simulations. The shape evolution and shrinkage kinetics of cylindrical grains with different tilt and mixed boundaries were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The mobility of low-angle (1 0 0) boundaries with misorientation angle {$>$}10\textdegree, obtained by both the experiments and simulations, does not differ from that of the high-angle boundaries, but decreases essentially with the further decrease of misorientation. The shape evolution of the embedded grains was found to relate directly to results of the energy computations. Further simulation results revealed that the shrinkage of grains with pure tilt boundaries is accompanied by grain rotation. In contrast, grains with the tilt-twist boundaries composed of dislocations with the mixed edge-screw character do not rotate as they shrink. \textcopyright{} 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Then we give the possible connector symmetries and orientations into a chiral space group, and the possible sliding and hinge joint locations and orientations compatible with the displacements in the groups. We present a framework for the design of lattice robots by assembling compatible joints and connectors into a chiral space group. Several two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples of designs are given to illustrate the framework.

One simple application is a method for smooth averaging of quaternions, which generalizes Shoemake's spherical linear interpolation. The weighted averages methods allow a novel method of defining B\'ezier and spline curves on spheres, which provides direct generalization of B\'ezier and B-spline curves to spherical spline curves. We present a fast algorithm for spline interpolation on spheres. Our spherical splines allow the use of arbitrary knot positions; potential applications of spherical splines include smooth quaternion curves for applications in graphics, animation, robotics, and motion planning. \textcopyright{} 2001, ACM.

  abstract = {Analysis of experimental data on grain boundaries (GBs) can involve putting data into angle ``bins.'' An example is Brandon's classification: if rotation angle and axis are each within\$\$15\^\textbackslash circ/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Sigma\}\$\$of a perfect coincidence site lattice (CSL) with density 1/{$\Sigma$}, the GBs can also be considered to be in that CSL relationship, and not if otherwise. Other examples of binning are studies of GB distributions in the full 5D angle space. To determine the size of a bin (necessary for densities, gradients, etc.) one must find a useful way, respecting symmetry, of determining metrics and measures on the full 5-dimensional space of both misorientation and interface normal. For a pair of low-angle GBs, the issue of metric is complicated by the fact that both their rotation axes and their GB normals can stay far apart as their rotation angles approach zero. We address all these issues as a dialog, and provide a framework for choosing metrics.},

  abstract = {Inverse problems deal with the quest for unknown causes of observed consequences, based on predictive models, known as the forward models, that associate the former quantities to the latter in the causal order. Forward models are usually well-posed, as causes determine consequences in a unique and stable way. Inverse problems, on the other hand, are usually ill-posed: the data may be insufficient to identify the cause unambiguously, an exact solution may not exist, and, like in a mystery story, discovering the cause without extra information tends to be highly sensitive to measurement noise and modeling errors. The Bayesian methodology provides a versatile and natural way of incorporating extra information to supplement the noisy data by modeling the unknown as a random variable to highlight the uncertainty about its value. Presenting the solution in the form of a posterior distribution provides a wide range of possibilities to compute useful estimates. Inverse problems are traditionally approached from the point of view of regularization, a process whereby the ill-posed problem is replaced by a nearby well-posed one. While many of the regularization techniques can be reinterpreted in the Bayesian framework through prior design, the Bayesian formalism provides new techniques to enrich the paradigm of traditional inverse problems. In particular, inaccuracies and inadequacies of the forward model are naturally handled in the statistical framework. Similarly, qualitative information about the solution may be reformulated in the form of priors with unknown parameters that can be successfully handled in the hierarchical Bayesian context.

However, there is no unified approach to the expression and computation of uncertainty, especially when coordinate transformations are involved. A generic approach to the uncertainty analysis of coordinate transformations based on constrained optimization uncertainty analysis is presented in this paper. The nonlinear constrained optimization algorithm used in this paper is a more generic algorithm for coordinate referencing than conventional 3-2-1 nesting method. We performed analysis on two types of uncertainty computation that relate to the final measurement: uncertainty of a single point in a world frame and uncertainty of distance measurement. The proposed method provides a mechanism for on-line assessment of measurement uncertainties on any coordinate measuring machines, mechanical or optical. Results of Monte Carlo simulation from a structured-light optical coordinate measurement machine (CMM) show that under normal machine operation conditions the approximations are valid. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

While sparse variational Gaussian process models are capable of learning from large-scale data, standard strategies for sparsifying the model can prevent the approximation of complex functions. In this work, we propose a novel variational Gaussian process model that decouples the representation of mean and covariance functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that this new parametrization generalizes previous models. Furthermore, it yields a variational inference problem that can be solved by stochastic gradient ascent with time and space complexity that is only linear in the number of mean function parameters, regardless of the choice of kernels, likelihoods, and inducing points. This strategy makes the adoption of largescale expressive Gaussian process models possible. We run several experiments on regression tasks and show that this decoupled approach greatly outperforms previous sparse variational Gaussian process inference procedures.},

In this work, we leverage a recently developed geodesic metric for grain boundaries to visualize the global geometry of grain boundary datasets and fit grain boundary energy to macroscopic grain boundary geometry. It is found that the 5D connectivity of the 388 grain boundary Olmsted dataset can be visualized via dimensionality reduction in 5D with a high degree of interpretability. Furthermore, after selectively adding new grain boundaries to the dataset, these visualizations suggest new global features of grain boundary space, including the existence of a grain boundary fundamental zone with well defined subsets of high symmetry boundaries along faces. Geodesic sampling is shown to be an effective tool to extend grain boundary datasets to new regions of the 5D space. Finally, a simple grain boundary energy kernel regression model with only one fitting parameter is demonstrated to predict grain boundary energy in the Olmsted dataset to within 10\% RMSE.},

The n-point property is a generalisation of this where, for any (n+1) objects in the space, there exists an n-dimensional simplex whose edge lengths correspond to the distances among the objects. In general, metric spaces do not have this property; however in 1953, Blumenthal showed that any semi-metric space which is isometrically embeddable in a Hilbert space also has the n-point property. We have previously called such spaces supermetric spaces, and have shown that many metric spaces are also supermetric, including Euclidean, Cosine, Jensen-Shannon and Triangular spaces of any dimension. Here we show how such simplexes can be constructed from only their edge lengths, and we show how the geometry of the simplexes can be used to determine lower and upper bounds on unknown distances within the original space. By increasing the number of dimensions, these bounds converge to the true distance. Finally we show that for any Hilbert-embeddable space, it is possible to construct Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimensions, from which these lower and upper bounds of the original space can be determined. These spaces may be much cheaper to query than the original. For similarity search, the engineering tradeoffs are good: we show significant reductions in data size and metric cost with little loss of accuracy, leading to a significant overall improvement in exact search performance.},

We consider the problem of inferring the 2D location and intensity of a radiation source in an urban environment using a ray-tracing model based on Boltzmann transport theory. Whereas the code implementing this model is relatively efficient, extension to 3D Monte Carlo transport simulations precludes subsequent Bayesian inference to infer source locations, which typically requires thousands to millions of simulations. Additionally, the resulting likelihood exhibits discontinuous derivatives due to the presence of buildings. To address these issues, we discuss the construction of surrogate models for optimization, Bayesian inference, and uncertainty propagation. Specifically, we consider surrogate models based on Legendre polynomials, multivariate adaptive regression splines, radial basis functions, Gaussian processes, and neural networks. We detail strategies for computing training points and discuss the merits and deficits of each method.},

  abstract = {The principled statistical application of Gaussian random field models used in geostatistics has historically been limited to data sets of a small size. This limitation is imposed by the requirement to store and invert the covariance matrix of all the samples to obtain a predictive distribution at unsampled locations, or to use likelihood-based covariance estimation. Various ad hoc approaches to solve this problem have been adopted, such as selecting a neighborhood region and/or a small number of observations to use in the kriging process, but these have no sound theoretical basis and it is unclear what information is being lost. In this article, we present a Bayesian method for estimating the posterior mean and covariance structures of a Gaussian random field using a sequential estimation algorithm. By imposing sparsity in a well-defined framework, the algorithm retains a subset of "basis vectors" that best represent the "true" posterior Gaussian random field model in the relative entropy sense. This allows a principled treatment of Gaussian random field models on very large data sets. The method is particularly appropriate when the Gaussian random field model is regarded as a latent variable model, which may be nonlinearly related to the observations. We show the application of the sequential, sparse Bayesian estimation in Gaussian random field models and discuss its merits and drawbacks. \textcopyright{} 2005 The Ohio State University.},

Some of the researchers working on the inverse conductivity problem for continuous media (the problem of recovering the conductivity inside from measurements on the outside) have taken an interest in the authors' analysis of this similar problem for resistor networks.The authors' treatment of inverse problems for electrical networks is at a fairly elementary level. It is accessible to advanced undergraduates, and mathematics students at the graduate level. The topics are of interest to mathematicians working on inverse problems, and possibly to electrical engineers. A few techniques from other areas of mathematics have been brought together in the treatment. It is this amalgamation of such topics as graph theory, medial graphs and matrix algebra, as well as the analogy to inverse problems for partial differential equations, that makes the book both original and interesting.},

In addition, there are programs for TEM defect image contrast, CBED, PED, Laue x-ray diffraction, and a new series of programs for computational polarized light microscopy. The programs can be used as standalone command-line programs, and produce HDF5 output files that can then be visualized using an IDL virtual app (Interactive Data Language) or read and processed from any other package with HDF5 capability. This is the first release of version 5.0; this release provides significant additions to the package and many changes under the hood. See below for a detailed list. We have changed the major version number from 4 to 5 because developers will need to rebuild the EMsoft\_SDK before recompiling the code. This release also coincides with the release of our new spherical indexing code which can be found here. Along with the new indexing package comes a new file format for efficient storage of the spherical harmonic transform of EBSD (for now) master patterns; the corresponding C++ code can be found here. This release also offers, for the first time, a series of python wrappers (pyEMsoft) that can be used to access selected EMsoft modules from python; an extensive set of examples is provided to illustrate how our library routines can be used.}

We propose a bootstrap procedure to estimate this optimal bandwidth, and show its consistency. These results remain valid for the case of no measurement error, and hence also summarize part of the theory of bootstrap bandwidth selection in ordinary kernel density estimation. The finite sample performance of the proposed bootstrap selection procedure is demonstrated with a simulation study. An application to a real data example illustrates the use of the method.},

  abstract = {In the framework of materials design there is the demand for extensive databases of specific materials properties. In this work we suggest an improved strategy for creating future databases, especially for extrinsic properties that depend on several material parameters. As an example we choose the energy of grain boundaries as a function of their geometric degrees of freedom. The construction of many existing databases of grain boundary energies in face-centred and body centred cubic metals relied on the a-priori knowledge of the location of important cusps and maxima in the five-dimensional energy landscape, and on an as-densely-as-possible sampling strategy. We introduce two methods to improve the current state of the art. Based on an existing energy model the location and number of the energy minima along which the hierarchical sampling takes place is predicted from existing data points without any a-priori knowledge, using a predictor function. Furthermore we show that in many cases it is more efficient to use a sequential sampling in a ``design of experiment'' scheme, rather than sampling all observations homogeneously in one batch. This sequential design exhibits a smaller error than the simultaneous one, and thus can provide the same accuracy with fewer data points. The new strategy should be particularly beneficial in the exploration of grain boundary energies in new alloys and/or non-cubic structures.},

We present a strategy to reduce the complexity of parametric searches for 3-D FE models of left ventricular contraction. The study employs automatic image segmentation and analysis of an image database to gain geometric features for several classes of patients. Statistical distributions of geometric parameters are then used to design parametric studies investigating the effects of: (1) passive material properties during ventricular filling, and (2) infarct geometry on ventricular contraction in patients after a heart attack. Gaussian Process regression is used in both cases to build statistical models trained on the results of biophysical FEM simulations. The first statistical model estimates unloaded configurations based on either the intraventricular pressure or the end-diastolic fiber strain. The technique provides an alternative to the standard fixed-point iteration algorithm, which is more computationally expensive when used to unload more than 10 ventricles. The second statistical model captures the effects of varying infarct geometries on cardiac output. For training, we designed high resolution models of non-transmural infarcts including refinements of the border zone around the lesion. This study is a first effort in developing a platform combining HPC models and machine learning to investigate cardiac function in heart failure patients with the goal of assisting clinical diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Finding the sparsest solution to underdetermined systems of linear equations y = {$\varphi$}x is NP-hard in general. We show here that for systems with "typical"/"random" {$\varphi$}, a good approximation to the sparsest solution is obtained by applying a fixed number of standard operations from linear algebra. Our proposal, Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP), successively transforms the signal into a negligible residual. Starting with initial residual r o = y, at the s-th stage it forms the "matched filter" {$\varphi$} Tr s-1, identifies all coordinates with amplitudes exceeding a specially chosen threshold, solves a least-squares problem using the selected coordinates, and subtracts the least-squares fit, producing a new residual. After a fixed number of stages (e.g., 10), it stops. In contrast to Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), many coefficients can enter the model at each stage in StOMP while only one enters per stage in OMP; and StOMP takes a fixed number of stages (e.g., 10), while OMP can take many (e.g., ).We give both theoretical and empirical support for the large-system effectiveness of StOMP.We give numerical examples showing that StOMP rapidly and reliably finds sparse solutions in compressed sensing, decoding of error-correcting codes, and overcomplete representation. \textcopyright{} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Neonatal F344 rats were infected with a rat-adapted influenza virus (RAIV) to use as a potential model to study the combined effects of air pollutant exposure with early life respiratory viral infections. Initially, 6-day-old pups were intranasally inoculated with RAIV or medium alone, and nasal and lower respiratory tract (LRT) tissues were assessed histologically at 1,3,6, and 13 days postinoculation (DPI). Immunologic assessments included thymic lymphocyte quantification and anti-RAIV immunoglobulin production. Pups then received two inoculations (at 6 and 30 days of age), with histologic and immunologic assessment 6 and 13 days after the second inoculation and bronchoprovocation testing 5-8 weeks later. Following the single RAIV inoculation, IgM and IgG1 measurements increased at 6, 11, and 15 DPI, with IgG1 being greater at 11 and 15 DPI. Nasal lesions were evident as early as 1 DPI and primarily involved the anterior dorsal medial meatus and adjacent dorsal atrio- and nasoturbinates. Alterations included epithelial cell exfoliation and necrosis, mild erosions, suppurative and nonsuppurative inflammation, intraepithelial neutrophil accumulations, and intraluminal exudate. By 3 DPI, olfactory epithelial damage was multifocal or locally diffuse, with degeneration of sensory cells and variable inflammation. By 13 DPI, lesions were essentially repaired. Minimal changes were apparent in the LRT despite evidence of viral replication in the lungs 24 hours after inoculation ({$>$}3 log10 plaque-forming units/lung). Pups reinoculated with RAIV at 30 days of age did not develop significant histologic lesions, nor did they exhibit increased airway responsiveness when assessed as young adults. In spite of their immature immune status at the time of initial infection, 13 days after the second RAIV inoculation, IgG1 increased substantially. Thus, neonatal RAIV infection resulted in acute nasal epithelial injury and inflammation, alterations that may allow subsequent evaluation of viral disease-air pollutant interactions.},

An algorithm for computing the Frechet derivatives of these functions is derived, based on perturbation theory for the matrix factorizations.

This work offers a rigorous and detailed introduction to the foundations of this theory, up to and including such advanced topics as orbital-dependent functionals as well as both time-dependent and relativistic DFT. Given the many ramifications of contemporary DFT, the text concentrates on the self-contained presentation of the basics of the most widely used DFT variants: this implies a thorough discussion of the corresponding existence theorems and effective single particle equations, as well as of key approximations utilized in implementations. The formal results are complemented by selected quantitative results, which primarily aim at illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of particular approaches or functionals.The structure and content of this book allow a tutorial and modular self-study approach: the reader will find that all concepts of many-body theory which are indispensable for the discussion of DFT - such as the single-particle Green's function or response functions - are introduced step by step, along with the actual DFT material. The same applies to basic notions of solid state theory, such as the Fermi surface of inhomogeneous, interacting systems. In fact, even the language of second quantization is introduced systematically in an Appendix for readers without formal training in many-body theory.},

The martensitic transformation created a microstructure whose grain boundary misorientation angle distribution had four distinct peaks that were consistent with the misorientations between the variants produced by the Burgers orientation relationship. Interestingly, about 60\% of population corresponded to 60\textdegree/[112\textasciimacron 0] intervariant boundaries. Three-variant clusters with a triangular morphology were observed frequently. This configuration is consistent with the phenomenological theory of martensite, which predicts that these clusters, separated by 60\textdegree/[112\textasciimacron 0] boundaries, have a lower transformation strain than other possible variant cluster arrangements. Other intervariant boundaries resulted from the impingement of different combinations of distinct three-variant clusters. The five-parameter boundary analysis revealed a strong anisotropy in the plane orientation distribution, showing that boundaries have a tendency to terminate on prismatic \{hki0\} and pyramidal \{101\textasciimacron 1\} planes, when misorientation was ignored. The dominant 60\textdegree/[112\textasciimacron 0] intervariant boundaries had symmetric tilt (1\textasciimacron 101) boundary planes, which are a low energy configuration.},

  abstract = {Anyone working on inverse problems is aware of their ill-posed character. In the case of inverse problems, this concept (ill-posed) proposed by J. Hadamard in 1902, admits revision since it is somehow related to their ill-conditioning and the use of local optimization methods to find their solution. A more general and interesting approach regarding risk analysis and epistemological decision making would consist in analyzing the existence of families of equivalent model parameters that are compatible with the prior information and predict the observed data within the same error bounds. Otherwise said, the ill-posed character of discrete inverse problems (ill-conditioning) originates that their solution is uncertain. Traditionally nonlinear inverse problems in discrete form have been solved via local optimization methods with regularization, but linear analysis techniques failed to account for the uncertainty in the solution that it is adopted. As a result of this fact uncertainty analysis in nonlinear inverse problems has been approached in a probabilistic framework (Bayesian approach), but these methods are hindered by the curse of dimensionality and by the high computational cost needed to solve the corresponding forward problems. Global optimization techniques are very attractive, but most of the times are heuristic and have the same limitations than Monte Carlo methods. New research is needed to provide uncertainty estimates, especially in the case of high dimensional nonlinear inverse problems with very costly forward problems. After the discredit of deterministic methods and some initial years of Bayesian fever, now the pendulum seems to return back, because practitioners are aware that the uncertainty analysis in high dimensional nonlinear inverse problems cannot (and should not be) solved via random sampling methodologies. The main reason is that the uncertainty "space" of nonlinear inverse problems has a mathematical structure that is embedded in the forward physics and also in the observed data. Thus, problems with structure should be approached via linear algebra and optimization techniques. This paper provides new insights to understand uncertainty from a deterministic point of view, which is a necessary step to design more efficient methods to sample the uncertainty region(s) of equivalent solutions. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The adjoint method is a powerful tool in geophysics that permits the computation of the exact first derivative of a physical observable or an associated objective function with respect to its parameters. Typical observables are displacement fields and flow patterns at the surface. Possible geophysical parameters are density, viscosity or elastic coefficients. When the observable can be modelled by solving a differential equation, the computation of the derivative only consists in solving the forward problem and its adjoint problem. Therefore, the adjoint method is far more efficient than any finite difference approximation. Here we present a mathematical formalism that generalises the derivation of the adjoint problem. In order to connect to work by Tarantola [Tarantola, A., 1984. Inversion of seismic reflection data in the acoustic approximation. Geophysics 49 (8), 1259-1266] we first give a derivation of the adjoint equations for the scalar wave equation in two dimensions. As objective function we choose the L2 distance between the modelled wave field and real data. In this case the adjoint problem coincides with the original forward problem, the only difference being that the adjoint field satisfies terminal rather than initial conditions. A numerical example in two dimensions demonstrates that the adjoint field focusses near the location of a parameter perturbation at the same time when the original wavefront reaches that location. Based on this simple example, we introduce a generalised formalism for the adjoint method. It is independent of the existence of Green's functions and their spatio-temporal reciprocity relations. Moreover, the formalism applies to non-linear equations such as the Navier-Stokes equations. This may become important in mantle flow reconstructions. The source term of the adjoint equations depends only on the specific objective function. Choosing the objective function to coincide with the observable itself allows us the computation of Jacobians, i.e., the derivative of the observable with respect to the model parameters. To demonstrate the consistency of our formalism with earlier analyses, we consider the anisotropic elastic wave equation with attenuation, which is of major interest in seismology. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This representation comes with algebraic and computational tools for comparing and interpolating between grain boundaries. We derive a geodesic metric based on the inner product between unit octonions, which themselves consist of pairs of quaternions describing the grain orientations in the reference frame of the grain boundary plane. We show how the metric behaves under the application of a number of symmetries: grain exchange symmetry; U(1) symmetry around the grain boundary normal; the no-boundary condition; and crystal symmetry. We show that this metric reproduces the Mackenzie distribution in the no-boundary case, and correctly determines the angular distances between grain boundaries with a common normal or misorientation. We provide a graphical representation of the mapping of quaternion pairs onto the octonion unit sphere, and describe a number of practical computations in the Supplementary Material accompanying this paper.},

One way to rapidly obtain databases to analyze is to use small-grained materials and high spatial resolution orientation microscopy techniques, such as ASTAR\texttrademark/precession electron diffraction. To demonstrate this, a study of grain boundary character distributions was conducted for {$\alpha$}-zirconium deposited at room temperature on fused silica substrates using physical vapor deposition. The orientation maps of the nanocrystalline thin films were acquired by the ASTAR\texttrademark/precession electron diffraction technique, a new transmission electron microscope based orientation microscopy method. The reconstructed grain boundaries were classified as pure tilt, pure twist, 180\textdegree -twist and 180\textdegree -tilt grain boundaries based on the distribution of grain boundary planes with respect to the angle/axis of misorientation associated with grain boundaries. The results of the current study were compared to the results of a similar study on {$\alpha$}-titanium and the molecular dynamics results of grain boundary energy for {$\alpha$}-titanium.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries of characteristic geometry, e.g., twist, tilt, and symmetric boundaries are often used as reference boundaries in analyses of boundary networks in polycrystalline materials. This article deals with the issue of proper identification of characteristic boundaries in the case of materials with hexagonal D 6h symmetry. To identify all boundaries of characteristic types, both analytical calculations and numerical searches are used. The first approach provides exact parameters of the characteristic boundaries, whereas the second one gives boundaries which can be classified as characteristic if some tolerance is allowed. In both methods, all symmetrically equivalent boundary representations are taken into consideration. The obtained sets of twist, tilt, symmetric, and 180\textdegree -tilt boundaries are presented in the form of two-dimensional maps containing stereographic projections of the corresponding boundary plane normals for selected grain misorientations. These diagrams facilitate interpretation of experimental distributions of grain boundaries; with the representation used, they can be directly linked to experimental distributions. Examples of such diagrams for lattice parameter ratios c/a of {$\surd$}5/2 and {$\surd$}20/21 are presented. They are compared to example boundary distributions in Ti alloy and distributions of WC/WC boundaries in WC-Co composites available in the literature. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s).},

For asymmetric tilt GBs (ATGBs) in aluminum, models were successfully established connecting the GB macro degrees of freedom (treated as process parameters) and energy (treated as property) to a low-rank GB atomic structure approximation derived from principal component analysis (PCA) of the full ensemble of PCFs aggregated for this study. More specifically, it has been shown that the models produced in this study resulted in average prediction errors less than 13 mJ/m2, which is less than the error associated with the underlying simulations when compared with experiments. This demonstration raises the potential for the development and application of PSP linkages from atomistic simulation datasets, and offers a powerful route for extracting high value actionable and transferrable knowledge from such computations.},

The central challenge in probabilistic inference is numerical integration, to average over ensembles of models or unknown (hyper-)parameters (for example to compute the marginal likelihood or a partition function). MCMC has provided approaches to numerical integration that deliver state-of-the-art inference, but can suffer from sample inefficiency and poor convergence diagnostics. Bayesian quadrature techniques offer a model-based solution to such problems, but their uptake has been hindered by prohibitive computation costs. We introduce a warped model for probabilistic integrands (likelihoods) that are known to be non-negative, permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations. Our algorithm is demonstrated to offer faster convergence (in seconds) relative to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and real-world examples.},

Metal lines deposited onto a thermally grooved surface using photolithography conform to the contours of the grain-boundary groove and provide a high-contrast reference line for measuring {$\Psi$}s by SEM. Measurements of {$\Psi$}s from optical interferometry and calculated from groove dimensions using surface diffusion models of thermal grooving are compared with the metal reference line measurements from the same thermally grooved surface of MgO-doped Al2O3. Distributions of {$\Psi$}s are found to shift to lower angles and approach the true {$\Psi$}s value as the resolution of the technique increases, with the MRL technique having the highest resolution, a median angle of 113\textdegree{$\pm$} 1\textdegree{} and a distribution of angles from 90\textdegree{$\pm$} 5\textdegree{} to 139\textdegree{$\pm$} 3\textdegree.

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) are central defects for describing polycrystalline materials, and playing major role in a wide-range of physical properties of polycrystals. Control over GB kinetics provides effective means to tailor polycrystal properties through material processing. While many approaches describe different GB kinetic phenomena, this review provides a unifying concept for a wide range of GB kinetic behavior. Our approach rests on a disconnection description of GB kinetics. Disconnections are topological line defects constrained to crystalline interfaces with both step and dislocation character. These characteristics can be completely specified by GB bicrystallography and the macroscopic degrees of freedom of GBs. GB thermal fluctuations, GB migration and the ability of GBs to absorb/emit other defects from/into the delimiting grains can be modeled via the nucleation, propagation and reaction of disconnections in the GB. We review the fundamentals of bicrystallography and its relationship to disconnections and ultimately to the kinetic behavior of GBs. We then relate disconnection dynamics and GB kinetics to microstructural evolution. While this review of the GB kinetics literature is not exhaustive, we review much of the foundational literature and draw comparisons from a wide swath of the extant experimental, simulation, and theoretical GB kinetics literature.},

  abstract = {Probabilistically formulated inverse problems can be solved using Monte Carlo-based sampling methods. In principle, both advanced prior information, based on for example, complex geostatistical models and non-linear forward models can be considered using such methods. However, Monte Carlo methods may be associated with huge computational costs that, in practice, limit their application. This is not least due to the computational requirements related to solving the forward problem, where the physical forward response of some earth model has to be evaluated. Here, it is suggested to replace a numerical complex evaluation of the forward problem, with a trained neural network that can be evaluated very fast. This will introduce a modeling error that is quantified probabilistically such that it can be accounted for during inversion. This allows a very fast and efficient Monte Carlo sampling of the solution to an inverse problem. We demonstrate the methodology for first arrival traveltime inversion of crosshole ground penetrating radar data. An accurate forward model, based on 2-D fullwaveform modeling followed by automatic traveltime picking, is replaced by a fast neural network. This provides a sampling algorithm three orders of magnitude faster than using the accurate and computationally expensive forward model, and also considerably faster and more accurate (i.e. with better resolution), than commonly used approximate forward models. The methodology has the potential to dramatically change the complexity of non-linear and non-Gaussian inverse problems that have to be solved using Monte Carlo sampling techniques.},

  abstract = {Though inverse theory and geostatistics share the same goal: To estimate some parameters of a model space from (possibly indirect) observations, they differ significantly in their approaches. When applying inverse theory one typically has some observations and some physical relation that maps model parameters into these observations. When applying geostatistics, one typically has some direct observations, and a priori covariance model to specify the spatial relations in the model space. In short, inverse theory focuses on the physical relation between model and data space, whereas geostatistics focuses on the spatial relation of model space. Here we combine linear inverse Gaussian theory and geostatistics, using sequential simulation to generate samples of the posterior probability distribution of any linear inverse Gaussian problem. In inverse theory the use of sequential simulation is new, and allows efficient simulation of models with relatively complex a priori information, through the a priori covariance model. In geostatistics, this is our first step into incorporating physical theory directly into the simulation process. We show an example applying sequential simulation to a tomography problem; a typical linear inverse problem.},

In order to sample the a posteriori probability density function we make use of both least squares based inversion, for linear Gaussian inverse problems, and the extended Metropolis sampler, for non-linear non-Gaussian inverse problems.

Contemporary fast intersection algorithms, which use SIMD instructions, focus on the intersection of ray packets against triangles. For intersection between single rays and triangles, operations such as horizontal addition or dot product are required. The SSE4 instruction set adds the dot product instruction which can be used for this purpose. This paper presents a new modification of the fast ray-triangle intersection algorithms commonly used, whichwhen implemented on SSE4outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms. It also allows both a single ray and ray packet intersection calculation with the same precomputed data.

Peaks in the grain neighbor misorientation angle distribution at 60 degrees ({$\sigma$}3) and 39 degrees ({$\sigma$}9) have resolution limited widths of {$\approx$} 0:14 degree FWHM. The analysis demonstrates that HEDM can recover grain and grain boundary statistics comparable to OIM volume measurements; more extensive data sets will lead to full, five parameter grain boundary character distributions.

The approximation is the minimizer in the native space for that kernel of a quadratic functional in which the smoothing term is a multiple of the square of the native space norm. The balance between data fitting and smoothness is controlled by a smoothing parameter, the choice of which should depend on the nature and magnitude of the noise. The main results concern the choice of that smoothing parameter, under the assumption that the noise is deterministic rather than random. Four strategies for choosing the smoothing parameter are considered: Morozov's discrepancy principle, and three a priori strategies. For each of these strategies we derive an L2 error bound. The error bounds are similar, with the discrepancy principle giving marginally the best bound. A numerical example supports the theoretical results.},

This work demonstrates how boundary plane orientation fundamental zones, which capture the natural crystallographic symmetries of a grain boundary, can be used to establish structure-property relationships. Using the fundamental zone representation, trends in computed energy, excess volume at the grain boundary, and temperature-dependent mobility naturally emerge and show a strong dependence on the boundary plane orientation. Analysis of common misorientation axes even suggests broader trends of grain boundary energy as a function of misorientation angle and plane orientation. Due to the strong structure-property relationships that naturally emerge from this work, boundary plane fundamental zones are expected to simplify analysis of both computational and experimental data. This standardized representation has the potential to significantly accelerate research in the topologically complex and vast five-dimensional phase space of grain boundaries.},

  abstract = {Barycentric coordinates were introduced by M\"obius in 1827 as an alternative to Cartesian coordinates. They describe points relative to the vertices of a simplex and are commonly used to express the linear interpolant of data given at these vertices. Generalized barycentric coordinates and kernels extend this idea from simplices to polyhedra and smooth domains. In this paper, we focus on Wachspress coordinates and Wachspress kernels with respect to strictly convex planar domains. Since Wachspress kernels can be evaluated analytically only in special cases, a common way to approximate them is to discretize the domain by an inscribed polygon and to use Wachspress coordinates, which have a simple closed form. We show that this discretization, which is known to converge quadratically, is safe in the sense that the Wachspress coordinates used in this process are well-defined not only over the inscribed polygon, but over the entire original domain.},

  abstract = {Barycentric coordinates can be used to express any point inside a triangle as a unique convex combination of the triangle's vertices, and they provide a convenient way to linearly interpolate data that is given at the vertices of a triangle. In recent years, the ideas of barycentric coordinates and barycentric interpolation have been extended to arbitrary polygons in the plane and general polytopes in higher dimensions, which in turn has led to novel solutions in applications like mesh parameterization, image warping, and mesh deformation. In this paper we introduce a new generalization of barycentric coordinates that stems from the maximum entropy principle. The coordinates are guaranteed to be positive inside any planar polygon, can be evaluated efficiently by solving a convex optimization problem with Newton's method, and experimental evidence indicates that they are smooth inside the domain. Moreover, the construction of these coordinates can be extended to arbitrary polyhedra and higher-dimensional polytopes. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Author(s) Journal compilation \textcopyright{} 2008 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

These changes are commonly related to enrichment by several orders of magnitude of the solutes at structural defects in the host lattice. The underlying concept\textemdash segregation\textemdash is thus fundamental in materials science. To include it in modern strategies of materials design, accurate and realistic computational modelling tools are necessary. However, the enormous number of defect configurations as well as sites solutes can occupy requires models which rely on severe approximations. In the present study we combine a high-throughput study containing more than 1 million data points with machine learning to derive a computationally highly efficient framework which opens the opportunity to model this important mechanism on a routine basis.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) often control the processing and properties of polycrystalline materials. Here, potentially transformative research is represented by constructing GB property diagrams as functions of temperature and bulk composition, also called ``complexion diagrams,'' as a general materials science tool on par with phase diagrams. However, a GB has five macroscopic (crystallographic) degrees of freedom (DOFs). It is essentially a ``mission impossible'' to construct property diagrams for GBs as a function of five DOFs by either experiments or modeling. Herein, we combine isobaric semi-grand canonical ensemble hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (hybrid MC/MD) simulations with a genetic algorithm (GA) and deep neural network (DNN) models to tackle this grand challenge. The DNN prediction is {$\sim$}108 faster than atomistic simulations, thereby enabling the construction of the property diagrams for millions of distinctly different GBs of five DOFs. Notably, excellent prediction accuracies have been achieved for not only symmetric-tilt and twist GBs, but also asymmetric-tilt and mixed tilt-twist GBs; the latter are more complex and much less understood, but they are ubiquitous and often limit the performance properties of real polycrystals as the weak links. The data-driven prediction of GB properties as function of temperature, bulk composition, and five crystallographic DOFs (i.e., in a 7D space) opens a new paradigm.},

Determining the atomic structure of the interface is therefore one of the most significant tasks in materials research. However, determining the interface structure usually requires extensive computation. If the interface structure could be efficiently predicted, our understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to the interface properties would be significantly facilitated, and this would pave the way for the design of material interfaces. Using a virtual screening method based on machine learning, we demonstrate a powerful technique to determine interface energies and structures. On the basis of the results obtained by a nonlinear regression using training data from 4 interfaces, structures and energies for 13 other interfaces were predicted. Our method achieved an efficiency that is more than several hundred to several tens of thousand times higher than that of the previously reported methods. Because the present method uses geometrical factors, such as bond length and atomic density, as descriptors for the regression analysis, the method presented here is robust and general and is expected to be beneficial to understanding the nature of any interface.},

Parametric and nonparametric supervised machine learning techniques were used to estimate saturated and near-saturated hydraulic conductivities (K s and K 10 , respectively) from easily measurable soil properties including the name of the pedological horizon (HOR), soil texture (sand, silt, and clay), organic matter (OM), bulk density (BD), and water contents (q pF1 , q pF2 , q pF3 , and q pF4.2 ) measured at four different matric heads (-10, -100, -1000, and -15,848 cm, respectively). Using a stepwise linear model (SWLM) and the Lasso regression as parametric methods with 316 data in training and 135 data in the testing phase, four pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were obtained in which water contents for both methods play an important role compared with other variables. The SWLM showed better performance than Lasso in the testing phase for log(K s ) and log(K 10 ) prediction, with RMSE values of 0.666 and 0.551 cm d -1 and R 2 of 0.26 and 0.65. Nonparametric supervised machine learning methods trained and tested with a similar data set significantly improved the accuracy of K s prediction, with R 2 of 0.52, 0.36, and 0.53 for Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), and ensemble (ENS) methods in the testing stage. These methods also described 74.9, 66.7, and 72.5\% of the variation of log(K 10 ). Bootstrapping validated the strong performance of nonparametric techniques. The feature selection capability of GPR determined that instead of using a model with all predictors, HOR, silt, q pF1 , and q pF3 are sufficient for the prediction of log(K s ), while HOR, silt, and OM can predict log(K 10 ) as accurate as the comprehensive model with all variables.},

However, recent studies employing similar methods, but different analytical techniques, have reached divergent conclusions regarding the effect of plantar fasciitis on hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot impulses. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the impulse distribution beneath the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot in subjects with, and without, plantar fasciitis was dependent on the analytic technique employed. A pressure platform was used to collect impulse estimates from 16 subjects with plantar fasciitis, and 16 control subjects, while walking at their preferred speed. The findings indicate that an impulse calculation incorporating the position of the center of pressure is more effective in detecting alterations in gait than the conventional method of estimating the impulse distribution beneath the foot. This study also demonstrates that subjects with plantar fasciitis possess modified gait patterns that are primarily manifest by a reduced hindfoot and an increased midfoot impulse, as defined by the pathway of the center of pressure.},

Analogous to classical, planar barycentric coordinates that describe the positions of points in a plane with respect to the vertices of a given planar polygon, spherical barycentric coordinates describe the positions of points on a sphere with respect to the vertices of a given spherical polygon. In particular, we introduce spherical mean value coordinates that inherit many good properties of their planar counterparts. Furthermore, we present a construction that gives a simple and intuitive geometric interpretation for classical barycentric coordinates, like Wachspress coordinates, mean value coordinates, and discrete harmonic coordinates. One of the most interesting consequences is the possibility to construct mean value coordinates for arbitrary polygonal meshes. So far, this was only possible for triangular meshes. Furthermore, spherical barycentric coordinates can be used for all applications where only planar barycentric coordinates were available up to now. They include B\'ezier surfaces, parameterization, free-form deformations, and interpolation of rotations.},

  abstract = {In astronomy, physics, climate modeling, geoscience, planetary science, and many other disciplines, the mass of data often comes from spherical sampling. Therefore, establishing an efficient and distortion-free representation of spherical data is essential. This paper introduces a novel spherical (global) coordinate system that is free of singularity. Contrary to classical coordinates, such as Cartesian or spherical polar systems, the proposed coordinate system is naturally defined on the spherical surface. The basic idea of this coordinate system originated from the classical planar barycentric coordinates that describe the positions of points on a plane concerning the vertices of a given planar triangle; analogously, spherical area coordinates (SACs) describe the positions of points on a sphere concerning the vertices of a given spherical triangle. In particular, the global coordinate system is obtained by decomposing the globe into several identical triangular regions, constructing local coordinates for each region, and then combining them. Once the SACs have been established, the coordinate isolines form a new class of global grid systems. This kind of grid system has some useful properties: the grid cells exhaustively cover the globe without overlapping and have the same shape, and the grid system has a congruent hierarchical structure and simple relationship with traditional coordinates. These beneficial characteristics are suitable for organizing, representing, and analyzing spatial data.},

  abstract = {The determination of grain boundary normals is an integral part of the characterization of grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials. These normal vectors are difficult to quantify due to the discretized nature of available microstructure characterization techniques. The most common method to determine grain boundary normals is by generating a surface mesh from an image of the microstructure, but this process can be slow, and is subject to smoothing issues. A new technique is proposed, utilizing first order Cartesian moments of binary indicator functions, to determine grain boundary normals directly from a voxelized microstructure image. To validate the accuracy of this technique, the surface normals obtained by the proposed method are compared to those generated by a surface meshing algorithm. Specifically, the local divergence between the surface normals obtained by different variants of the proposed technique and those generated from a surface mesh of a synthetic microstructure constructed using a marching cubes algorithm followed by Laplacian smoothing is quantified. Next, surface normals obtained with the proposed method from a measured 3D microstructure image of a Ni polycrystal are used to generate grain boundary character distributions (GBCD) for {$\Sigma$}3 and {$\Sigma$}9 boundaries, and compared to the GBCD generated using a surface mesh obtained from the same image. The results show that the proposed technique is an efficient and accurate method to determine voxelized fields of grain boundary normals.},

Three types of symmetric tilt grain boundaries between close-packed face-centered-cubic crystals were produced: {$\Sigma$}5(100),{$\Sigma$}17(100), and {$\Sigma$}3(110). The structure of the crystals and their defects were visualized by confocal microscopy, and characterized by simple geometric measurements, including image difference, thresholding, and reprojection. This provided a quick and straightforward way to detect the regions in which the atoms are mobile. This atomic mobility was higher at the grain boundaries and close to the solid-liquid interface. This method was compared to the more conventional analysis based on the calculation of the local order parameter of the individual particles to identify the interface. This was used in turn to identify the presence of grooves at the grain-boundary-liquid triple junction for every type of grain boundary, except for the twin [{$\Sigma$}3(110)], for which no groove could be detected. Images of these grooves were processed, and the angle linking the grain boundary energy to the solid-liquid interfacial energy was measured. The resulting values of the grain boundary energy were compared to estimates based on the density deficit in the boundary.},

  abstract = {A common way to account for uncertainty in inverse problems is to apply Bayes' rule and obtain a posterior distribution of the quantities of interest given a set of measurements. A conventional Bayesian treatment, however, requires assuming specific values for parameters of the prior distribution and of the distribution of the measurement errors (e.g., the standard deviation of the errors). In practice, these parameters are often poorly known a priori, and choosing a particular value is often problematic. Moreover, the posterior uncertainty is computed assuming that these parameters are fixed; if they are not well known a priori, the posterior uncertainties have dubious value. This paper describes extensions to the conventional Bayesian treatment that assign uncertainty to the parameters defining the prior distribution and the distribution of the measurement errors. These extensions are known in the statistical literature as "empirical Bayes" and "hierarchical Bayes." We demonstrate the practical application of these approaches to a simple linear inverse problem: using seismic traveltimes measured by a receiver in a well to infer compressional wave slowness in a 1D earth model. These procedures do not require choosing fixed values for poorly known parameters and, at most, need a realistic range (e.g., a minimum and maximum value for the standard deviation of the measurement errors). Inversion is thus made easier for general users, who are not required to set parameters they know little about. \textcopyright{} 2004 Society of Exploration Geophysicists. All rights reserved.},

This allows the input noise to be recast as output noise proportional to the squared gradient of the GP posterior mean. The input noise variances are inferred from the data as extra hyperparameters. They are trained alongside other hyperparameters by the usual method of maximisation of the marginal likelihood. Training uses an iterative scheme, which alternates between optimising the hyperparameters and calculating the posterior gradient. Analytic predictive moments can then be found for Gaussian distributed test points. We compare our model to others over a range of different regression problems and show that it improves over current methods.},

  abstract = {Grain-boundary migration controls grain growth, which is important in material processing and synthesis. When a vertical grain boundary ends at a horizontal free surface, a groove forms at the tip to reduce the combined grain-boundary and surface energies. The groove affects the migration of the grain boundary, and its effect must be understood. This work studies grain-boundary grooving by capillarity-driven surface diffusion with asymmetric and strongly anisotropic surface energies. The surface energies are described by the delta-function facet model that holds for temperatures above the roughening temperature of the bicrystal. Since the asymmetric anisotropy does not introduce a length scale, the asymmetric groove still grows with time t as t14. Thus, the nonlinear partial differential equation that governs grooving is reduced by a self-similar transformation to an ordinary differential equation, which is then solved numerically by shooting methods. We vary systematically the crystallographic orientations of the bicrystal and the normalized grain-boundary energy. We find that the self-similar groove profile is faceted and asymmetric for most bicrystals. However, a few asymmetric bicrystals can also yield smooth and symmetric grooves. Some bicrystals may even form ridges instead of grooves. We also find that the asymmetric surface energies tilt the grain-boundary tip sideways, which induces the grain boundary to migrate. We show that anisotropic groove profiles measured in SrTiO3 and Ni can be well fitted by our model. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

Analysis of these sets requires grouping boundaries with similar parameters, and thus one needs a measure of similarity or a distance between interfaces. A number of such functions have been previously defined. Interface distances are constructed in two steps: first, an underlying metric is devised, and then it is modified to account for equivalences between points in the space of macroscopic parameters. The paper characterizes and compares the known underlying distance functions. Features important for a function to be applicable as the interface distance are considered. The main aspects are the invariance with respect to symmetries in the parameter space and the property of metric intrinsicality which is essential for analysis of interface distributions. Also ways of devising alternative metrics are described, and suggestions for choosing a standard metric which may serve in conventional computations are given. Results of the metric characterization are of importance for laying out foundations of the statistical analysis of macroscopic grain boundary data.},

  abstract = {Functional data analysis (FDA) involves the analysis of data whose ideal units of observation are functions defined on some continuous domain, and the observed data consist of a sample of functions taken from some population, sampled on a discrete grid. Ramsay \& Silverman's (1997) textbook sparked the development of this field, which has accelerated in the past 10 years to become one of the fastest growing areas of statistics, fueled by the growing number of applications yielding this type of data. One unique characteristic of FDA is the need to combine information both across and within functions, which Ramsay and Silverman called replication and regularization, respectively. This article focuses on functional regression, the area of FDA that has received the most attention in applications and methodological development. First, there is an introduction to basis functions, key building blocks for regularization in functional regression methods, followed by an overview of functional regression methods, split into three types: (a) functional predictor regression (scalar-on-function), (b) functional response regression (function-on-scalar), and (c) function-on-function regression. For each, the role of replication and regularization is discussed and the methodological development described in a roughly chronological manner, at times deviating from the historical timeline to group together similar methods. The primary focus is on modeling and methodology, highlighting the modeling structures that have been developed and the various regularization approaches employed. The review concludes with a brief discussion describing potential areas of future development in this field.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference enables the fusion of heterogeneous information and the reduction of epistemic uncertainty for solving inverse problems. Physical models, expert knowledge and experimental data are statistically interpreted in order to learn about the unknown model parameters. The prior and the posterior probability distribution represent the uncertainty of the unknowns before and after the analysis. Bayes' theorem governs the update from the prior to the conditional posterior which reflects the achieved gain of information. Characterizing the posterior distribution poses the main challenge in Bayesian data analysis. Since only very simple problems admit analytical solutions, most often one has to compute the posterior numerically. This formidable task is accomplished by means of Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The large number of forward model runs that is thereby required prohibits computational inference in many fields of application. In civil, mechanical and aerospace engineering this holds especially true. The goal of this doctoral dissertation is to develop new approaches to the Bayesian probabilistic analysis in complex and realistic engineering applications. A unified framework for inverse problems under epistemic uncertainty and aleatory variability is elaborated to that end. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is used as an efficient sampling algorithm that overcomes the associated computational difficulties. Moreover, completely novel methods for posterior computation are presented and investigated.},

  abstract = {The absolute grain boundary mobility of 388 nickel grain boundaries was calculated using a synthetic driving force molecular dynamics method; complete results appear in the Supplementary materials. Over 25\% of the boundaries, including most of the non-{$\Sigma$}3 highest mobility boundaries, moved by a coupled shear mechanism. The range of non-shearing boundary mobilities is from 40 to 400 m/s GPa, except for {$\Sigma$}3 incoherent twins which have mobilities of 200-2000 m/s GPa. Some boundaries, including all the {$\langle$}1 1 1{$\rangle$} twist boundaries, are immobile within the resolution of the simulation. Boundary mobility is not correlated with scalar parameters such as disorientation angle, {$\Sigma$} value, excess volume or boundary energy. Boundaries less than 15\textdegree{} from each other in five-dimensional crystallographic space tend to have similar mobilities. Some boundaries move via a non-activated motion mechanism, which greatly increases low-temperature mobility. Thermal roughening of grain boundaries is widely observed, with estimated roughening temperatures substantially among boundaries. \textcopyright{} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Bayesian Quadrature is a modelbased method for numerical integration which, relative to standard Monte Carlo methods, offers increased sample efficiency and a more robust estimate of the uncertainty in the estimated integral. We propose a novel Bayesian Quadrature approach for numerical integration when the integrand is non-negative, such as the case of computing the marginal likelihood, predictive distribution, or normalising constant of a probabilistic model. Our approach approximately marginalises the quadrature model's hyperparameters in closed form, and introduces an active learning scheme to optimally select function evaluations, as opposed to using Monte Carlo samples. We demonstrate our method on both a number of synthetic benchmarks and a real scientific problem from astronomy.},

We address both the forward problem, namely computing an average of given anchor points on the mesh with given weights, and the inverse problem, which is computing the weights given anchor points and a target point. Solving the forward problem on a mesh enables applications such as splines on surfaces, Laplacian smoothing and remeshing. Combining the forward and inverse problems allows us to define a correspondence mapping between two different meshes based on provided corresponding point pairs, enabling texture transfer, compatible remeshing, morphing and more. Our algorithm solves a single instance of a forward or an inverse problem in a few microseconds. We demonstrate that anchor points in the above applications can be added/removed and moved around on the meshes at interactive framerates, giving the user an immediate result as feedback.

  abstract = {This paper develops an efficient computational method for solving a Gaussian process (GP) regression for large spatial data sets using a collection of suitably defined local GP regressions. The conventional local GP approach first partitions a domain into multiple non-overlapping local regions, and then fits an independent GP regression for each local region using then training data belonging to the region. Two key issues with the local GP are (1) the prediction around the boundary of a local /region is not as accurate as the prediction at interior of the local region, and (2) two local GP regressions for two neighboring local regions produce diffierent predictions at the boundary of the two regions, creating undesirable discontinuity in the prediction. We address these issues by constraining the predictions of local GP regressions sharing a common boundary to satisfy the same boundary constraints, which in turn are estimated by the data. The boundary constrained local GP regressions are solved by a finite element method. Our approach shows competitive performance when compared with several state-of-the-art methods using two synthetic data sets and three real data sets.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries (GBs) influence a wide array of physical properties in polycrystalline materials and play an important role in governing microstructural evolution under extreme environments. While the importance of interfaces is well documented, their properties are among the least understood of all the defect types present in engineering material systems. This is due to the vast configurational space of interfaces, resulting in a diverse range of structures and properties. The complexity associated with GB structures is related to the different crystallographic degrees of freedom \textendash{} the misorientation, the boundary-plane orientation and the relative translations between the adjoining crystals. These unique challenges can be addressed by leveraging high-throughput simulations of GB properties and developing machine learning algorithms grounded in the concepts of bicrystallography of interfaces. To demystify the relationships between crystallography and properties, the symmetry aspects of GBs are reviewed with an emphasis on boundary-plane orientations and disconnection line defects. To quantify structure-property relationships, recent advances in describing GB structures using the polyhedral unit model and the gaussian-based approximation of local atomic environments are discussed. Finally, examples of predicting GB structure-property relationships using machine learning techniques are summarized. As part of a special issue, the goal of this review article is to motivate machine learning strategies that are informed by bicrystallography and novel structural descriptors for developing reliable crystallography-structure-property relationships for grain boundaries.},

This method is second order accurate, and has shown to be competitive and computationally efficient.

In addition, we show how the method can be used to interpolate constrained quantities so that the given constraint is automatically respected. We showcase the method with two astrophysics related examples situated in the curved Kerr space-time. The first problem is interpolating a locally constant vector field, in which case curvature effects are expected to be maximally important. The second example is a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a turbulent accretion flow around a black hole, wherein high intrinsic variability is expected to be at least as important as curvature effects.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (3D-EBSD)is a technique for microstructure characterization that works by sequential sectioning via mechanical polishing, Focused Ion Beam (FIB)milling or layer ablation by laser. In this technique, consecutive steps of sample preparation and EBSD measurement are employed to extract 2D-EBSD sections and to reconstruct the 3D microstructure. The 3D data collected by the serial sectioning technique, suffer from misalignment between the adjacent sections. In the present work, serial sectioning by mechanical polishing was employed to collect 3D EBSD data of a dual-phase (DP)steel sample. A previously developed algorithm based on the minimization of misorientation between the neighboring sections was utilized to accurately align the consecutive sections. The reconstructed microstructure was then used to validate the accuracy of the alignment algorithm. The results show that the alignment procedure has successfully improved the reconstructed 3D microstructure and produced reconstructed sections, which in terms of microstructural parameters (i.e. grain size and morphology), image quality and kernel average misorientation distribution resemble the results of a directly measured EBSD experiment and can be used to differentiate the 3D morphology and crystallography of martensite from ferrite in DP steels.},

  abstract = {Five macroscopic boundary parameters can be extracted from three-dimensional orientation maps. Serial sectioning, which includes consecutive steps of material removal, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurement were employed to extract a stack of two-dimensional sections of a pure nickel sample. The EBSD patterns were collected from large millimetre scale areas and mechanical polishing was applied to prepare the sections. The three-dimensional microstructure was then reconstructed from these sections. A new alignment algorithm based on the minimization of misorientation between two adjacent sections has been developed to accurately align the sections. Differently from the conventional alignment methods, the new algorithm corrects not only the translational misalignment but also rotational and plane parallelity misalignments. The aligned three-dimensional microstructure exhibits smooth grain boundary planes and continuous orientation gradients inside the grains as experimental scatter induced by misalignment was largely removed. Grain boundaries were reconstructed from the aligned three-dimensional map, and the distribution of boundaries in the domain of five macroscopic boundary parameters was computed using kernel density estimation. Methods for estimating the reliability of the distributions are demonstrated. This distribution is compared with the distributions obtained previously for other face-centered cubic materials, including a different pure nickel sample.},

Our method combines a variant of the classical Bowyer\textendash Watson point insertion algorithm with the recently published parallelization technique by Jacobsen et al. It resolves a breakdown situation of the latter approach and is suitable for practical implementation because of its compact formulation. Some complementary aspects are discussed such as the parallel workload and floating-point arithmetics. In a second step, the generated triangulations are reordered by a stripification algorithm. This improves cache performance and significantly reduces data-read operations and indirect addressing in multi-threaded stencil loops.

  abstract = {Thermal grooving at a grain-boundary is well-understood when the surface of the groove is entirely rough (finite surface stiffness) at its root. In this situation, the grain-boundary energy is uniquely related to the surface energy of the groove at its root via the dihedral angle that is obtained by enforcing equilibrium (balance of capillary forces) at the triple-junction. However, when a groove-root is faceted, the non-analyticity of the surface energy at the facet orientation leads to ambiguities in both the enforcement of equilibrium at the groove-root and the relation between the facet energy and the grain-boundary energy. In this work, we show that equilibrium at the groove-root requires careful consideration of the torque, which can adjust itself to maintain the fixed facet orientation for a range of grain-boundary energies thereby achieving a net balance of capillary forces. This is in stark contrast to the case of a rough root where the grain-boundary energy is in one-to-one correspondence with the observed dihedral angle. Using this insight, we show via a simple graphical method that the grain-boundary energy and surface energy function are entirely adequate to determine if a groove-root is faceted or rough thereby obviating the need for any ad hoc specification of the dihedral angle as a boundary condition. The evolution of thermal grooves is studied using a variational approach that can handle infinite surface stiffnesses and naturally allow for facet formation. The mobility of the triple-junction, which is know to lead to deviations from Mullins' t1/4 scaling law, is also explicitly included in the model. A key observation is that low junction-mobilities can lead to the formation of kinetic groove-shapes - in particular, groove-roots that are anticipated to be rough from energetic considerations alone are seen instead to attain nearby facet orientations at low junction mobilities. Such kinetically limited facets at groove-roots can never be obtained if the equilibrium angle is prescribed as a boundary condition for the evolution equation as is often done. We also extend our analysis to the more realistic case of asymmetric grooves and present a graphical procedure that elucidates their structure. \textcopyright{} 2005 Acta Materialia Inc.

This decrease occurred because the majority of the newly generated {$\Sigma$}3 grain boundaries were not coherent twins with \{1 1 1\} grain boundary plane orientations. GBE increased the proportion of {$\Sigma$}3 boundary length that was vicinal-to-\{1 1 1\} and the proportion of asymmetrical {$\langle$}1 1 0{$\rangle$} tilt boundaries. There was a clear propensity for selection of particular planes or plane combinations which were associated with low energy.

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe the five-parameter grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) of polycrystalline silicon and compare it to distributions measured in metals and ceramics. The GBCD was determined from the stereological analysis of electron backscatter diffraction maps. The distribution of grain boundary disorientations is non-random and has peaks at 36\textdegree, 39\textdegree, 45\textdegree, 51\textdegree, and 60\textdegree. The axis-angle distribution reveals that most of the grain boundaries have misorientations around the [111], [110], and [100] axes. The most common grain boundary type (30 \% number fraction) has a 60\textdegree{} misorientation around [111] and of these boundaries, the majority are twist boundaries. For other common boundaries, symmetric tilt configurations are preferred. The grain boundary character distribution of Si is distinct from those previously observed for metals and ceramics. The measured grain boundary populations are inversely correlated to calculated grain boundary energies available in the literature. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

  abstract = {The grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) of nanotwinned copper, fabricated by electroplating inside small-scale through-wafer vias, was characterized using a stereological interpretation of electron backscatter diffraction maps. The GBCD of electroplated nanotwinned copper, specified by five macroscopic parameters (three for the lattice misorientation and two for the grain boundary plane inclination), is similar to the GBCD of coarse-grained polycrystalline copper used here as a reference material. The GBCD was compared to calculated grain boundary energies determined from atomistic simulations. We find that the grain boundary population in the electroplated nanotwinned and coarse-grained reference copper is both on average inversely correlated to the grain boundary energies. The slopes of the relationships between grain boundary population and energy for the most highly populated misorientations ({$\Sigma$}3, {$\Sigma$}9, and {$\Sigma$}11) are different. The relationships are strongly influenced by the geometric constraints at the triple junctions and multiple twinning, which enhanced the observed frequencies of {$\Sigma$}9 boundaries. The results suggest that the grain boundary network and the GBCD in the polycrystalline specimens are strongly influenced by the microstructure, grain boundary energy, and multiple twining.},

Such numerical populations are relevant to network topology and the modeling of intergranular failure modes in grain boundary engineered materials, and are distinct from geometrical population measures such as area per volume. We examine 3-D reconstructions of stainless steel and copper, with varying populations of twin-related boundaries, generated by serial-section electron backscatter diffraction and high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy. We show that 2-D length fractions, 2-D number fractions and 3-D number fractions are all distinct quantities when grain boundary type is correlated with grain boundary size. We also demonstrate that the last quantity may be reliably inferred from the first two, provided the experimental spatial resolution is much finer than the grain size, eliminating the need to use 3-D experimental methods to access at least some information about 3-D network properties. Many of the {$\Sigma$}3 boundaries are extremely complex, with highly re-entrant shapes that can intersect a sample plane many times, giving a false impression of multiple separate boundaries. \textcopyright{} 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

This extends on the authors' earlier methods for integrating over the surface of a sphere and over arbitrarily shaped smooth closed surfaces by also considering domain boundaries. The core approach consists again of combining RBF-FD (radial basis function-generated finite difference) approximations for curved surface triangles, which together make up the full surface. The provided examples include both curved and flat domains. In the highly special case of equi-spaced nodes over a regular interval in 1-D, the method provides a new opportunity for improving on the classical Gregory enhancements of the trapezoidal rule.},

Using these results, we perform the first large-scale comparison between measured and computed grain boundary energies. While the overall correlation between experimental and computed energies is minimal, there is excellent agreement for the data in which we have the most confidence, particularly the experimentally prevalent {$\Sigma$}3 and {$\Sigma$}9 boundary types. Other CSL boundaries are infrequently observed in the experimental system and show little correlation with computed boundary energies. Because they do not depend on observation frequency, computed grain boundary energies are more reliable than the experimental energies for low population boundary types. Conversely, experiments can characterize high population boundaries that are not included in the computational study. Together the experimental and computational data provide a comprehensive catalog of grain boundary energies in Ni that can be used with confidence by microstructural scientists. \textcopyright{} 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

This information has been used to calculate the grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) and the grain boundary energy distribution (GBED). The twin content from the three-dimensional GBCD calculation compares favourably with the twin content estimated by stereology. Important factors in the analysis are the alignment of the parallel layers, the ratio of the out-of-plane to in-plane spacing of the discrete orientation data and the discretisation of the domain of grain boundary types. The results show that grain boundaries comprised of (111) planes occur most frequently and that these grain boundaries have a relatively low energy.

Unfortunately, analysis of these models to extract the relevant physics is never as easy as applying machine learning to a large data set in the first place. Here we present a description of atomic systems that generates machine learning representations with a direct path to physical interpretation. As an example, we demonstrate its usefulness as a universal descriptor of grain boundary systems. Grain boundaries in crystalline materials are a quintessential example of a complex, high-dimensional system with broad impact on many physical properties including strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, crack resistance, and conductivity. In addition to modeling such properties, the method also provides insight into the physical "building blocks" that influence them. This opens the way to discover the underlying physics behind behaviors by understanding which building blocks map to particular properties. Once the structures are understood, they can then be optimized for desirable behaviors.},

Two representations were needed for these machine learning applications: 1) the ASR representation, based on averaged local environment descriptors; and 2) the LER descriptor, based on fractions of globally unique local environments within the entire GB system. We present a detailed tutorial on how to construct these two representations to learn energy, mobility and shear coupling. Additionally, we catalog some of the null results encountered along the way.},

  abstract = {In materials science the orientation of a crystal lattice is described by means of a rotation relative to an external reference frame. A number of rotation representations are in use, including Euler angles, rotation matrices, unit quaternions, Rodrigues\textendash Frank vectors and homochoric vectors. Each representation has distinct advantages and disadvantages with respect to the ease of use for calculations and data visualization. It is therefore convenient to be able to easily convert from one representation to another. However, historically, each representation has been implemented using a set of often tacit conventions; separate research groups would implement different sets of conventions, thereby making the comparison of methods and results difficult and confusing. This tutorial article aims to resolve these ambiguities and provide a consistent set of conventions and conversions between common rotational representations, complete with worked examples and a discussion of the trade-offs necessary to resolve all ambiguities. Additionally, an open source Fortran-90 library of conversion routines for the different representations is made available to the community.},

The anisotropy is determined using a Cahn-Hoffman capillarity vector analysis of the energy balance at a triple junction. The absolute solid-solid grain bondary energy for each individual boundary is then determined by using the known value for the solid-liquid energy. A total of 136 boundaries are analyzed, with 46 of them forming grain boundaries. The remaining boundaries are found to be wetted boundaries with thin-liquid films formed between the two particles. A correlation between the low interfacial energy and the probability of occurrence for that disorientation is also observed. We also show that the anisotropy, as quantified by the magnitude of the torque term, is a significant portion of the total interfacial energy, especially for low energy boundaries. The degree of twist vs tilt of the boundaries is also analyzed. As expected, there are more tilt boundaries within the system than twist boundaries and most of the low energy boundaries have a mixed tilt-twist character.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a method for defining and efficiently computing barycentric coordinates with respect to polygons on general surfaces. Our construction is geared towards injective polygons (polygons that can be enclosed in a metric ball of an appropriate size) and is based on replacing the linear precision property of planar coordinates by a requirement in terms of center of mass, and generalizing this requirement to the surface setting. We show that the resulting surface barycentric coordinates can be computed using planar barycentric coordinates with respect to a polygon in the tangent plane. We prove theoretically that the surface coordinates properly generalize the planar coordinates and carry some of their useful properties such as unique reconstruction of a point given its coordinates, uniqueness for triangles, edge linearity, similarity invariance, and smoothness; in addition, these coordinates are insensitive to isometric deformations and can be used to reconstruct isometries. We show empirically that surface coordinates are shape-aware with consistent gross behavior across different surfaces, are well-behaved for different polygon types/locations on variety of surface forms, and that they are fast to compute. Finally, we demonstrate effectiveness of surface coordinates for interpolation, decal mapping, and correspondence refinement.

This paper presents a new numerical method for determining the grain boundary energy distribution (GBED) from the microstructures of polycrystalline materials. The method assumes that triple junctions are in local equilibrium, that this equilibrium is described by the Herring equation, and can be expressed using the Hoffman-Cahn formalism of the capillarity vector. The conventional method discretizes the five-parameter space and then fits the energy for each discrete bin. The new method minimizes the difference between similar boundaries in the dataset while obeying the equilibrium equation at triple junctions. This non-parametric approach shows smaller error than the conventional method, and it can also determine the grain boundary energies from datasets that have small numbers of triple junctions if their configurations are clustered in the five-parameter space, which is not possible using the conventional method. In addition, the proposed non-parametric approach performs better when the number of triple junctions increases, which is not always true for the conventional method.},

We here present two classes of high order methods for discretization on the surface of a sphere, first finite difference schemes satisfying the summation-by-parts property on the cube sphere grid, secondly finite volume discretizations on unstructured grids with polygonal cells. Furthermore, we also implement the seventh order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO7) scheme for the cube sphere grid. For the finite difference approximation, we prove a stability estimate, derived from projection boundary conditions. For the finite volume method, we develop the implementational details by working in a local coordinate system at each cell.

  abstract = {There are many algorithms based on computation of intersection of lines, planes etc. Those algorithms are based on representation in the Euclidean space. Sometimes, very complex mathematical notations are used to express simple mathematical solutions. This paper presents solutions of some selected problems that can be easily solved by the projective space representation. Sometimes, if the principle of duality is used, quite surprising solutions can be found and new useful theorems can be generated as well. It will be shown that it is not necessary to solve linear system of equations to find the intersection of two lines in the case of E2 or the intersection of three planes in the case of E3. Pl\"ucker coordinates and principle of duality are used to derive an equation of a parametric line in E3 as an intersection of two planes. This new formulation avoids division operations and increases the robustness of computation. The presented approach for intersection computation is well suited especially for applications where robustness is required, e.g. large GIS/CAD/CAM systems etc.},

  abstract = {Similar to free surfaces, the grain boundaries (GBs) in metals, semiconductors and insulators can contain flat (faceted) and curved (rough) portions. In the majority of cases, facets are parallel to the most densely packed planes of coincidence sites lattice formed by two lattices of abutting grains. Facets disappear with the increasing temperature (faceting\textendash roughening transition) and the increasing angular distance from coincidence misorientation. The temperature of GB faceting\textendash roughening transition TR decreases with the increasing inverse density of coincidence sites {$\Sigma$}. In case of fixed {$\Sigma$}, TR decreases with the decreasing density of coincidence sites in the GB plane. The intersection line (ridge) between facets or between facets and curved (rough) portions of surfaces can be of first order (two different tangents in the contact point) or of second order (common tangent, continuous transitions). The rough (curved) portions of GB can also form the first-order rough-to-rough ridges (with two tangents). GB facets control the transition from normal to abnormal grain growth and strongly influence the GB migration, diffusion, wetting, fracture and electrical conductivity.},

  abstract = {To specify a grain boundary at a macroscopic length scale requires the specification of five degrees of freedom. We use a specification in which three degrees of freedom associated with the boundary misorientation are in an orthogonal subspace from two associated with the mean boundary plane. By using Rodrigues vectors to describe rotations, we show how paths through these subspaces may be characterized. Some of these paths correspond to physical processes involving grain boundaries during microstructural evolution. Exploiting the orthogonality of the subspaces, a metric to measure 'distance' between two boundaries is defined in terms of the minimum set of rotations required to map one boundary on to the other. We compare our metric with others that have appeared. The existence of rotational symmetry in face-centred cubic crystals leads to as many as 2304 equivalent specifications of a boundary. We illustrate this multiplicity of descriptions for the (111) twin and a more general boundary. We present an algorithm to evaluate the geodesic distance between two boundaries, and apply it to identify the path along which the distance between these two boundaries is minimized. In general, the shortest path does not involve descriptions of boundary misorientations with the smallest misorientation angles.},

These include, (i) low reciprocal volume density of coincidence sites; (ii) high planar density of coincidence sites, {$\Gamma$}; (iii) high {$\Gamma$} at constant interplanar spacing, d; (iv) large d; and (v) high density of locked-in rows of atoms. These criteria are then tested against available experimental results which include measurements of: (a) interfacial energy; (b) rotations of crystallites on flat crystal substrates; (c) boundary faceting; (d) boundary dissociation; and (e) observations of grain boundary dislocations. No support for the general usefulness of criteria (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) is found. In all cases, significant numbers of results violating these criteria are found or else it is demonstrated that their range of validity is undefined, and, hence, their predictive power is highly limited. Criterion (iii) is found to apply for a limited number of cases involving metal/metal or ionic/ionic interfaces but fails for metal/ionic interfaces. Further testing and consideration of this criterion seems called for. It is concluded that no general and useful criterion for low energy can be enshrined in a simple geometric framework. Any understanding of the variations of interfacial energy must take account of the atomic structure and the details of the bonding at the interface. \textcopyright{} 1987.},

  abstract = {The local barycentric coordinates (LBC), proposed in Zhang et al. (2014), demonstrate good locality and can be used for local control on function value interpolation and shape deformation. However, it has no closed-form expression and must be computed by solving an optimization problem, which can be time-consuming especially for high-resolution models. In this paper, we propose a new technique to compute LBC efficiently. The new solver is developed based on two key insights. First, we prove that the non-negativity constraints in the original LBC formulation is not necessary, and can be removed without affecting the solution of the optimization problem. Furthermore, the removal of this constraint allows us to reformulate the computation of LBC as a convex constrained optimization for its gradients, followed by a fast integration to recover the coordinate values. The reformulated gradient optimization problem can be solved using ADMM, where each step is trivially parallelizable and does not involve global linear system solving, making it much more scalable and efficient than the original LBC solver. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our technique on a large variety of models.},

When the heat released during grain growth is normalized to the change in grain boundary area, the specific excess enthalpy at low temperatures and fine grain sizes (600 degrees-780 degrees C, 30-200 nm) is found to be 0.5-1 J/m(2), while values averaged over a larger temperature and size range (600 degrees-1300 degrees C, 30 nm-similar to 2 mu m) are 1.3-1.7 J/m(2). After exclusion of extraneous contributions from other heat-dissipating processes, origins of a specific grain boundary enthalpy that increases with grain size or temperature are considered, including solute segregation, changes in grain boundary structure, and contributions from grain boundary triple junctions. It is concluded that the most plausible explanation is a size-dependent nonstoichiometry of TiO2 due to the impingement of space charge layers in the temperature and grain size range of the experiments.},

Like any other polynomial projection, the study concerns the growth, as the degree \$n\$ tends to infinity, of the associated Lebesgue constant, i.e., of the uniform norm of the least squares operator. If the least squares polynomial of degree \$n\$ is based on a set of points, which are nodes of a positive weighted quadrature rule of degree of exactness \$2n\$, then we state two different sufficient conditions for having an optimal Lebesgue constant that increases with \$n\$ at the minimal projections order. Hence, under our assumptions least squares and hyperinterpolation polynomials provide a comparable approximation with respect to the uniform norm.},

However, it is still a significantly difficult task to create complex sharp features for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines compatible subdivision surfaces. Current non-uniform subdivision methods produce sharp features generally by setting zero knot intervals, and these sharp features may have unpleasant visual effects. In this paper, we construct a non-uniform subdivision scheme to create complex sharp features by extending the eigen-polyhedron technique. The new scheme allows arbitrarily specifying sharp edges in the initial mesh and generates non-uniform cubic B-spline curves to represent the sharp features. Experimental results demonstrate that the present method can generate visually more pleasant sharp features than other existing approaches.},

The constitutive relations are explicitly formulated and these show that the theoretical anisotropic material behaves like a liquid crystal. The integrable nonlinear equation may be used to advantage as test cases for numerical schemes. Its form has many attributes of the nonlinear governing equation for an isotropic material.

  abstract = {Molybdenum has many attractive properties for high-temperature structural applications. However, its usefulness as a structural material is impaired by brittleness at and below ambient temperature, resulting from its intrinsically weak grain boundary strength. According to our previous study, the fracture strength in molybdenum depends markedly on the grain boundary character and, in particular, on the orientation relationship between the two adjacent crystals and the orientation of the grain boundary plane. However, our present knowledge is still far from a complete understanding. In this study, the relationship between the strength, grain boundary structure and grain boundary energy has been investigated for purified biccrystals of molybdenum with various {$<$}110 {$>$} symmetric tilt boundaries, by means of transmission electron microscopy and optical interferometry. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) There is a relatively good correlation between the fracture strength and the grain boundary energy. The energy cusps, for instance, are observed for (112) and (111) {$\Sigma$}3 coincidence boundaries, which are high in fracture strength, while the energy is higher for near (114) and (122) {$\Sigma$}9 boundaries, which are low in strength. (2) {$\Sigma$}1 small angle and near (112) {$\Sigma$}3 coincidence boundaries have a good coherence, which agrees well with the result of the boundary energy measurement. Grain boundary dislocations are observed and they can be described by the boundary dislocation model. (3) On the (114) {$\Sigma$}9 coincidence boundary with low fracture strength, the structure is poor in coherence compared with {$\Sigma$}1 and {$\Sigma$}3 boundaries. However, the grain boundary structure can also be described by the grain boundary dislocation (displacement shift complete (DSC) dislocation) model. (4) It is considered that the grain boundary structure in molybdenum with a high covalency in bonding is not greatly different from that in normal metals.},

Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to determine the energies and mobilities of grain boundaries as a function of boundary misorientation. The mesoscopic simulations were performed both with the Monte Carlo Potts model and the phase field model. The Monte Carlo Potts model and phase field model simulation predictions are in excellent agreement. While the atomistic simulations demonstrate strong anisotropies in both the boundary energy and mobility, both types of microstructural evolution simulations demonstrate that anisotropy in boundary mobility plays little role in the stochastic evolution of the microstructure (other than perhaps setting the overall rate of the evolution. On the other hand, anisotropy in the grain boundary energy Strongly modifies both the topology of the polycrystalline microstructure the kinetic law that describes the temporal evolution of the mean grain size. The underlying reasons behind the strongly differing effects of the two types of anisotropy considered here can be understood based largely on geometric and topological arguments.},

  abstract = {We present an extensible software framework, hIPPYlib, for solution of large-scale deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with infinite-dimensional parameter fields (which are high-dimensional after discretization). hIPPYlib overcomes the prohibitive nature of Bayesian inversion for this class of problems by implementing state-of-the-art scalable algorithms for PDE-based inverse problems that exploit the structure of the underlying operators, notably the Hessian of the log-posterior. The key property of the algorithms implemented in hIPPYlib is that the solution of the deterministic and linearized Bayesian inverse problem is computed at a cost, measured in linearized forward PDE solves, that is independent of the parameter dimension. The mean of the posterior is approximated by the MAP point, which is found by minimizing the negative log-posterior. This deterministic nonlinear least-squares optimization problem is solved with an inexact matrix-free Newton-CG method. The posterior covariance is approximated by the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log posterior evaluated at the MAP point. This Gaussian approximation is exact when the parameter-to-observable map is linear; otherwise, its logarithm agrees to two derivatives with the log-posterior at the MAP point, and thus it can serve as a proposal for Hessian-based MCMC methods. The construction of the posterior covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the Hessian of the log-likelihood. Scalable tools for sample generation are also implemented. hIPPYlib makes all of these advanced algorithms easily accessible to domain scientists and provides an environment that expedites the development of new algorithms. hIPPYlib is also a teaching tool to educate researchers and practitioners who are new to inverse problems and the Bayesian inference framework.},

These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

  abstract = {Grain boundaries always have a positive excess free energy that drives grain growth and structural evolution during high-temperature heat treatments. Grain boundaries can, however, become trapped in a metastable configuration because of the geometry or composition of the specimens in which they are contained. For example, second phase dispersoids can pin grain boundaries in a polycrystal, and thermal grooves can pin grain boundaries in thin films and wires. In these examples of frustrated grain boundary systems, further reduction in the grain boundary area is energetically preferred, but grain boundary migration is arrested because energy is required to create additional grain boundary surface area and de-pin from the obstacle. In this work, we consider an idealized class of frustrated grain boundaries, namely curved grain boundaries in geometrically complex bicrystals. By calculating the energy landscape of the grain boundary configuration space, we show that the local stability of these curved grain boundaries is a sensitive function of the bicrystal shape. We also assess the trajectory of curved grain boundaries in bicrystals grown via directional solidification to determine which grain boundary configurations are physically realizable. By comparing these two analyses, we find that a curved grain boundary may be thermodynamically metastable but kinematically inaccessible, highlighting the general importance of thermodynamics and kinematics in descriptions of frustrated grain boundary systems encountered in a wide range of different materials.},

  abstract = {In this paper we provide an extension of barycentric coordinates from simplices to arbitrary convex sets. Barycentric coordinates over convex 2D polygons have found numerous applications in various fields as they allow smooth interpolation of data located on vertices. However, no explicit formulation valid for arbitrary convex polytopes has been proposed to extend this interpolation in higher dimensions. Moreover, there has been no attempt to extend these functions into the continuous domain, where barycentric coordinates are related to Green's functions and construct functions that satisfy a boundary value problem. First, we review the properties and construction of barycentric coordinates in the discrete domain for convex polytopes. Next, we show how these concepts extend into the continuous domain to yield barycentric coordinates for continuous functions. We then provide a proof that our functions satisfy all the desirable properties of barycentric coordinates in arbitrary dimensions. Finally, we provide an example of constructing such barycentric functions over regions bounded by parametric curves and show how they can be used to perform freeform deformations. \textcopyright{} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the quality of polynomial interpolation approximations over the sphere Sr-1 {$\subset$} {$\mathbb{R}$}r in the uniform norm, principally for r = 3. Reimer [17] has shown there exist fundamental systems for which the norm {$\parallel$} {$\Lambda$}n {$\parallel$} of the interpolation operator {$\Lambda$}n, considered as a map from C(Sr-1) to C(Sr-1), is bounded by dn, where dn is the dimension of the space of all spherical polynomials of degree at most n. Another bound is dn1/2 ({$\lambda$}avg/{$\lambda$}min)1/2, where {$\lambda$}avg and {$\lambda$}min are the average and minimum eigenvalues of a matrix G determined by the fundamental system of interpolation points. For r = 3 these bounds are (n + 1)2 and (n + 1) ({$\lambda$}avg/{$\lambda$}min)1/2, respectively. In a different direction, recent work by Sloan and Womersley [24] has shown that for r = 3 and under a mild regularity assumption, the norm of the hyperinterpolation operator (which needs more point values than interpolation) is bounded by O(n1/2), which is optimal among all linear projections. How much can the gap between interpolation and hyperinterpolation be closed? For interpolation the quality of the polynomial interpolant is critically dependent on the choice of interpolation points. Empirical evidence in this paper suggests that for points obtained by maximizing {$\lambda$}min, the growth in {$\parallel$} {$\Lambda$}n {$\parallel$} is approximately n + 1 for n {$<$} 30. This choice of points also has the effect of reducing the condition number of the linear system to be solved for the interpolation weights. Choosing the points to minimize the norm directly produces fundamental systems for which the norm grows approximately as 0.7n + 1.8 for n {$<$} 30. On the other hand, 'minimum energy points', obtained by minimizing the potential energy of a set of (n + 1)2 points on S2, turn out empirically to be very bad as interpolation points. This paper also presents numerical results on uniform errors for approximating a set of test functions, by both interpolation and hyperinterpolation, as well as by non-polynomial interpolation with certain global basis functions.},

  abstract = {We propose nonparametric methods for functional linear regression which are designed for sparse longitudinal data, where both the predictor and response are functions of a covariate such as time. Predictor and response processes have smooth random trajectories, and the data consist of a small number of noisy repeated measurements made at irregular times for a sample of subjects. In longitudinal studies, the number of repeated measurements per subject is often small and may be modeled as a discrete random number and, accordingly, only a finite and asymptotically nonincreasing number of measurements are available for each subject or experimental unit. We propose a functional regression approach for this situation, using functional principal component analysis, where we estimate the functional principal component scores through conditional expectations. This allows the prediction of an unobserved response trajectory from sparse measurements of a predictor trajectory. The resulting technique is flexible and allows for different patterns regarding the timing of the measurements obtained for predictor and response trajectories. Asymptotic properties for a sample of n subjects are investigated under mild conditions, as n \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}, and we obtain consistent estimation for the regression function. Besides convergence results for the components of functional linear regression, such as the regression parameter function, we construct asymptotic pointwise confidence bands for the predicted trajectories. A functional coefficient of determination as a measure of the variance explained by the functional regression model is introduced, extending the standard R2 to the functional case. The proposed methods are illustrated with a simulation study, longitudinal primary biliary liver cirrhosis data and an analysis of the longitudinal relationship between blood pressure and body mass index. \textcopyright{} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2005.},

While the forward problem of computing the gravity field from a given mass distribution is mathematically straightforward, the inverse of this forward map has some interesting features that make inversion a difficult problem. In particular, the forward map has an infinite-dimensional kernel which makes the inversion fundamentally non-unique. We characterize completely the kernels of two gravitational forward maps, one mapping mass density to the Newtonian scalar potential, and the other mapping mass density to the gravity gradient tensor, which is the quantity most commonly measured in field observations. In addition, we present some results on unique inversion under constrained conditions, and comment on the roles the kernel of the forward map and non-uniqueness play in discretized approaches to the continuum inverse problem.},

The grooving kinetics obey power laws with the exponent 1/4. When the anisotropy is critical surface faceting occurs. And, when it is severe the facets coarsen in the evolution. We exhibit the groove profiles in evolution under different degrees of anisotropy.

  abstract = {The problem of interpolation at (n+1)2 points on the unit sphere double-struck S2 by spherical polynomials of degree at most n is proved to have a unique solution for several sets of points. The points are located on a number of circles on the sphere with even number of points on each circle. The proof is based on a method of factorization of polynomials. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer.},
