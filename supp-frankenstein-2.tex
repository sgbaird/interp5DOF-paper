\section{Fe Input Data Quality}
	\label{sec:supp:kim-interp:quality}
	Of the $\sim$\num{60000}\footnote{The "no-boundary" \glspl{gb} (i.e. \glspl{gb} with close to \SI{0}{\joule\per\square\meter} \gls{gbe}) were removed before testing for degeneracy.} \glspl{gb} in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014}, $\sim$\num{10000} \glspl{gb} were repeats that were identified by converting to \glspl{vfzgbo} and applying \vfzorepo{} function \texttt{avg\_repeats.m}. In \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014}, mechanically selected \glspl{gb} were those which involved sampling in equally spaced increments\footnote{In some cases, this was equally spaced increments of the argument of a trigonometric function.} for each \gls{5dof} parameter, and a few thousand intentionally selected \glspl{gb} (i.e. special \glspl{gb}) were also considered. Of mechanically and intentionally selected \glspl{gb}, \numlist{9170;112} are repeats, respectively, with a total of \num{2496} degenerate sets\footnote{A degenerate "set" is distinct from a \gls{vfzgbo} "set", the latter of which is often used in the main text.} (see \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-sets} for a degeneracy histogram). Thus, on average there is a degeneracy of approximately four per set of degenerate \glspl{gb}.
	
	By comparing \gls{gbe} values of (unintentionally\footnote{To our knowledge, the presence of repeat \glspl{gb} were not mentioned in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} or \cite{kimIdentificationSchemeGrain2011}}) repeated \glspl{gb} in the Fe simulation dataset \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014}, we can estimate the intrinsic error of the \inpt{} data. For example, minimum and maximum deviations from the average value of a degenerate set are \SIlist{-0.2625;0.2625}{\joule\per\square\meter}, respectively, indicating that a repeated Fe \gls{gb} simulation from \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} can vary by as much as \SI{0.525}{\joule\per\square\meter}, though rare. Additionally, \Gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} values can be obtained within each degenerate set by comparing against the set mean. Overall \gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} are then obtained by averaging and weighting by the number of \glspl{gb} in each degenerate set. Following this procedure, we obtain an average set-wise \gls{rmse} and \gls{mae} of \SIlist{0.06529;0.06190}{\joule\per\square\meter}, respectively, which is an approximate measure of the intrinsic error of the data. \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results} shows histograms and parity plots of the intrinsic error. The overestimation of intrinsic error mentioned in the main text (\cref{sec:results:simulation}) could stem from bias as to what type of \glspl{gb} exhibit repeats based on the sampling scheme used in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} and/or that many of the degenerate sets contain a low number of repeats (\cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-sets}).
	
	Next, we see that by binning \glspl{gb} into degenerate sets, most degenerate sets have a degeneracy of fewer than 5 \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-sets}. We split the repeated data into sets with a degeneracy of fewer than 5 and greater than or equal to 5 and plot the errors (relative to the respective set mean) in both histogram form (\cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}a and \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}c, respectively) and as hexagonally-binned parity plots (\cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}b and \cref{fig:kim-interp-degeneracy-results}d, respectively). While heavily repeated \glspl{gb} tend to give similar results, occasionally repeated \glspl{gb} often have larger \gls{gbe} variability. This could have physical meaning: Certain types of (e.g. high-symmetry) \glspl{gb} tend to have less variation (i.e. fewer and/or more tightly distributed metastable states). However, it could also be an artifact of the simulation setup that produced this data (e.g. deterministic simulation output for certain types of \glspl{gb}).

Large degenerate sets tend to have very low error, whereas small degenerate sets tend to have higher error. In other words, \glspl{gb} that are more likely to be repeated many times based on the sampling scheme in \cite{kimPhasefieldModeling3D2014} tend to give similar results, whereas \glspl{gb} that are less likely to be repeated often have larger variability in the simulation output. We do not know if this has physical meaning or is an artifact of the simulation setup.}

	% \subsection{Uncertainty Quantification and the Posterior Distribution of \glsentrytitlecase{gprm}{long} }
	% The use of \gls{gpr} in the \gls{gprm} model facilitates uncertainty quantification which we discuss in more detail. We find that use of \cref{eq:gprmix-sigma} on two models with differing amounts of data leads to a model with typically higher uncertainty for low \glspl{gbe} than high \glspl{gbe} (\cref{fig:kim-interp-posterior}a). By observing the \glspl{nn} relative to an arc $\overline{AB}$, we find that there is a large scatter of \glspl{gbe} for \glspl{gb} that are within a radius of $\sim$\SI{6}{\degree} (\cref{fig:kim-interp-posterior}b). By sampling from the posterior distribution, we find that
